        <p id="ai6" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In a recent whitepaper titled "Poverty Shapes Oral Health," DSO Benevis highlighted the connection between socioeconomic status and oral healthcare access, revealing that older, lower-income adults experience triple the amount of untreated tooth decay compared to their higher-income counterparts. Children with public insurance also receive less dental treatment than those with private insurance. Dr. Jane Whang, Regional Director of Clinical at Benevis, discussed these findings and the state of dental care accessibility in the U.S., emphasizing that socioeconomic disparities persist and affect overall health. Misconceptions about oral healthcare include assuming that free care is accessible and fair, as well as overlooking the need for adult dental coverage as people live longer. Solutions to alleviate these disparities proposed by Dr. Whang include stopping cuts to Medicaid, making enrollment processes easier, providing support for more providers to accept Medicaid insurance, and implementing better fee packages to sustain practices amidst increased costs in the dental industry. The biggest concern is that upcoming cuts could lead to fewer providers accepting Medicaid, further decreasing access to care for vulnerable populations.</p>

        <p id="ai7" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The U.S. employment situation saw minimal growth in June, according to a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, signaling a potential slowing economy. However, the healthcare sector showed encouraging gains, with hospitals, physician offices, and dental offices adding a surprising number of jobs. This unexpected development was discussed by Dr. Barry Lyon, DDS, who connected with Becker's for a weekly series on dental industry topics. Despite overall disappointing job growth, healthcare added 55,400 jobs, representing nearly 76% of the total jobs added in July. Dental offices specifically saw an increase of 7,100 employees. This growth is surprising given the hiring challenges faced by dentistry and medicine since the Great Resignation began in 2020. The question remains whether this could mark a turnaround for the dental profession or if it's just a temporary gain before broader economic realities set in.</p>
