        <p id="ai1" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">September is recognized as Dental Infection Control Awareness Month (DICAM), an annual event emphasizing the importance of infection prevention in dental practices. This year, the Association for Dental Safety (ADS) focuses on "Embracing a Culture of Safety: Empowering Patients and the Dental Team," stressing the mutual benefits that come with a shared commitment to safety.

Each week, ADS will highlight different infection control priorities such as hand hygiene, dental unit waterlines, instrument reprocessing, and personal protective equipment (PPE). To assist dental teams in their efforts, ADS offers free toolkits containing ready-to-use materials for social media and marketing, as well as resources for infection prevention and safety.

ADS has also introduced Ask ADS, an AI-powered assistant providing real-time answers to infection control questions and customized checklists. To get involved, visit the ADS website (<https://www.myads.org/dicam>) and share the hashtag #DICAM25 on social media platforms.</p>

        </span>
        <p id="ai2" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In an interview with Dentistry Today, experts from HuFriedyGroup emphasize the importance of maintaining dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) for patient safety and staff protection. While DUWLs are essential for cooling and irrigating during dental procedures, they can harbor bacterial growth due to their small size and potential stagnation.

Bacteria can form a slimy protective layer of biofilm in the waterlines, which continues to feed and multiply without regular cleaning, disinfection, and monitoring. This biofilm is difficult to remove once established, requiring a "waterline shock treatment" to remove it.

Recent years have seen increased attention to waterline safety due to outbreaks linked to contaminated dental waterlines, particularly in pediatric dental offices. Vulnerable patients like children, the elderly, immunocompromised individuals, and even dental staff are at risk of exposure to contaminated dental waterlines.

States are starting to enact laws requiring quarterly dental waterline testing, with more likely to follow. Practices should look to their state dental board, CDC, ADA, and ADS for guidance on the best methods for ensuring clean water.

The DentaPure Cartridge, a product by HuFriedyGroup, is designed for use on DUWLs attached to dynamic instruments. It contains iodinated resin beads that release 2 to 6ppm of elemental iodine into the water passing through the cartridges, controlling bacterial growth. One cartridge maintains compliant procedural water for 365 days or 240L of water and is easy to install and use.

Elemental iodine in the DentaPure Cartridge does not cause sensitivity reactions, and at typical elution rates, exposure during a dental visit is far exceeded by common foods like milk and eggs. The system is simple to use with minimal learning curve.

The consistent implementation of waterline maintenance protocols benefits both patients and staff by reducing the risk of infection and ensuring compliance with microbiological standards. Regular testing, shocking, and maintenance are essential for assessing compliance, verifying proper implementation of protocols, and ensuring lines are clean and ready for continued patient treatment.</p>

        <p id="ai3" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In "Measured by More", Dr. Maggie Augustyn reflects on her struggle with envy and how it affected her self-worth. She recounts envying those who seemed to have more successful families, financial security, beauty, intelligence, or happiness than herself. This led to a deep sense of unworthiness and mental distress. However, a chance encounter with a former colleague who revealed she envied Dr. Augustyn for building her life and success independently, changed her perspective.

Dr. Augustyn learned that envy is not about what others have or what we lack, but about our perspective. It arises from misunderstanding others and ourselves, magnifying the imagined ease of someone else's path while diminishing the value of our struggles and accomplishments. She encourages readers to pause when envy sets in, reflect on their own journey, and remember their worth—not defined by what they lack, but by all that they have endured, created, and become.

The story underscores the importance of gratitude, self-compassion, and pride in overcoming envy. It reminds us that every person carries unseen burdens and that the lives we admire may be shaped by challenges we cannot comprehend. Dr. Augustyn is a practicing general dentist, author, and inspirational speaker who strives to inspire others through her writing and speaking engagements.</p>

        <p id="ai9" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Christie & Co has announced the sale of Bridgeton Cross Dental Practice in Glasgow, a well-established three-surgery dental practice with over 10,000 registered patients. The practice, founded in 1960, was owned by Dr. Sobia Bhatti since 2011, who decided to sell to reduce management responsibilities and spend more time with her family.

First-time buyer Nicole Egan purchased the practice through a confidential sales process facilitated by Joel Mannix at Christie & Co. Funding was sourced via Stephen McConalogue at Christie Finance. Egan plans to leverage the strong community demand for NHS services, utilize existing operational surgeries, and expand patient capacity with an additional fully-equipped surgery.

Joel Mannix, director of dental at Christie & Co, praised the process and the quality of the practice in a prime location, while Stephen McConalogue expressed his satisfaction in securing finance for another first-time buyer entering the dental sector. The sale price was undisclosed.</p>

        <p id="ai12" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Five dental and health-related closures have been reported since April:

1. MetroHealth, a Cleveland-based system, is shutting down one of its dental clinics on October 3 due to financial challenges. The closure is part of a broader budget restabilization plan that includes six office closures, aimed at streamlining operations and increasing access at single locations.

2. Dental Group Orthodontics in Dumas, Texas, closed permanently without providing a reason for the closure. Patients have been advised to seek care at their Amarillo, Texas location instead.

3. Western Dental, based in Orange, California, warned in May that up to 50 of its practice locations might close if proposed cuts to the Medi-Cal dental program were implemented. The cuts would decrease dental insurance reimbursement rates, making it difficult for the DSO to maintain operations.

4. Scott Ervin's dental practice in Terrell, Texas, temporarily closed following the sudden passing of Dr. Ervin in May. The practice resumed operation on June 11 after hiring a new dentist to continue patient care.

5. The emergency dental clinic in Santa Ana, California, run by the Orange County Health Care Agency, has been shut down due to federal funding cuts. The healthcare agency lost five grants worth $13 million, leading to the closure of several facilities.</p>

        <p id="ai13" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In a recent development, concerns have been raised over the acquisition of Madison-based DSO Cherry Tree Dental by Delta Dental of Wisconsin. Critics argue that this merger could violate federal antitrust laws due to potential conflicts of interest within the dental community and a reduction in competition. The American Economic Liberties Project and the Alliance of Independent Dentists have addressed their concerns in a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division, the Federal Trade Commission, and Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul. They allege that the acquisition may breach Section 7 of the Clayton Act, which prohibits mergers that could lessen competition, as well as guidelines set by the Justice Department's ATR Division and the FTC in 2023. Delta Dental of Wisconsin has stated that Cherry Tree will operate as a separate entity, but the American Dental Association is looking into the potential legal and regulatory implications of the deal, while the Wisconsin Dental Association has requested state monitoring of insurer acquisitions.</p>

        <p id="ai19" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued guidance for manufacturers of dental bone grafting materials, aiming to reduce animal testing. The document offers recommendations to comply with special controls and increase transparency, while promoting the "3Rs" principle: replace, reduce, or refine animal use. Manufacturers are encouraged to consult with the FDA if they wish to employ alternative non-animal testing methods.

Bone grafting has risen in popularity due to advancements in regenerative medicine and new biomaterials, as well as increasing patient demand for bone restoration. Approximately half of all dental implant procedures involve bone grafts, with around 2.2 million procedures performed annually at an estimated cost of $664 million in 2021. The rate of operations to repair bone defects is projected to grow by roughly 13% annually. Autografting, using a patient's own bone for dental implantation and reconstruction, remains the gold standard.

Animal-derived materials, such as xenografts from cows, pigs, horses, camels, and ostriches, are commonly used in dental bone grafting procedures. The first successful bone transplant was reported in 1668 by Dutch surgeon Job van Meekeren.</p>
