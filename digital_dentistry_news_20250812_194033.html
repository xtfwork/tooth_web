The focus of the webinar is on the advancements in bonded bridges, an alternative to dental implants, particularly in situations where implants may not be as minimally invasive or problem-free as previously thought.

Dr. Ruiz will discuss indications for using bonded bridges, principles for success, and preparation designs suitable for various anterior and posterior teeth scenarios. The webinar will also cover step-by-step techniques for temporizing and predictable cementation of different restorative materials, including zirconia.

In summary, the webinar aims to equip clinicians with the knowledge and skills to effectively utilize bonded bridges as a viable alternative to dental implants in certain cases.</p>

        <p id="ai8" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize dental practices over the next five years, according to Sundeep Rawal, Senior Vice President of implant support services for Aspen Dental. In an interview, he foresees AI significantly impacting both patient care and practice operations. The dental office of the future will be fundamentally different, with AI influencing design work, manufacturing, diagnostics, and business operations.

The delivery of dental care is expected to undergo a transformation, becoming more standardized, predictable, and data-driven. Diagnosis and treatment plans will become more objective based on data, leading to more predictable outcomes. The execution of care may also become "instantaneous," enabling patients to receive needed care quickly. This shift aligns with society's growing demand for immediate services.

Dr. Rawal believes the consumer-oriented model of dental care in the U.S. will enable it to outpace other areas of medicine in terms of innovation and adaptability, making dental care more accessible and efficient in the future.</p>

        <p id="ai9" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The American Fluoridation Society has expressed opposition to recent moves by federal officials regarding community water fluoridation in the U.S. The Environmental Protection Agency plans to review potential health risks of fluoride, following HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s announcement to advise the CDC against adding fluoride to public water supplies. Additionally, the FDA aims to remove ingestible fluoride prescription drugs for children.

The American Fluoridation Society contests EPA's impartiality in review due to RFK Jr.'s stance and considers the attacks on fluoride as a misinterpretation of evidence. They point to a recent Make America Healthy Again report, which cites 74 high-quality studies reviewed by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) as a basis for their concerns about fluoride. However, the AFS highlights that 70% of these studies were rated as low quality by the NTP. The report also found no link between low IQ scores and U.S. water supplies' fluoride levels.

The AFS raises several concerns regarding the NTP's research methodology and addresses the FDA's concern about ingesting fluoride affecting gut bacteria, stating that microbiologists have already dismissed this concern.</p>

        <p id="ai15" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article discusses concerns in the dental industry, with traditional threats such as staffing shortages and rising operational costs being overshadowed by another issue: the high cost of dental school tuition. Dr. Robert Baskies, a dentist from Phillipsburg, NJ, argues that this excessive cost is the real threat to dental independence. He graduated in 1978 with just $13,000 in debt, equivalent to $64,000 in 2025, and managed to pay for his tuition by working as a nurse's aide during summers. Today, average tuition costs around $70,000 per year, making it challenging for students to legally earn enough money to cover these expenses. Dr. Baskies believes that the increased cost has made dental independence a fantasy for the new generation of dentists, who will likely become similar to pharmacists within chain drug stores in the next decade.</p>

        <p id="ai18" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">A new study conducted by Health and Care Research Wales Evidence Centre at Cardiff University reveals that many Welsh residents lack understanding of the roles within NHS dental teams and how to access urgent dental care. The research, involving 44 participants across all seven health boards in Wales, found that while most recognized dentists, dental nurses, and dental hygienists, few were aware of dental technicians or dental therapists. Participants often used the term "dental assistant" for any professional working alongside a dentist, suggesting a lack of awareness about team members' specific training and scope of practice.

The confusion extends to urgent dental care pathways, with many unsure about what constitutes a dental emergency, who to contact, or where to go for help. While some said they would call their own dentist or NHS 111, others admitted that they might unnecessarily attend accident and emergency departments. The study's authors suggest that this lack of knowledge could undermine current reforms aimed at encouraging patients to seek care from the most appropriate professional.

The participants proposed solutions such as multichannel public awareness campaigns, school-based education, and community outreach, which would clarify the makeup of dental teams and distinguish between routine, urgent, and emergency care. The study titled "Public awareness of care pathways and available skill mix in NHS dental teams: A qualitative study" was published on 11th July 2025 in the British Dental Journal.</p>
