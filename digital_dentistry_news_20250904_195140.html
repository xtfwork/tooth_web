With the dental industry landscape continuously evolving, dentists are always on the lookout for ways to ensure their practice is working with rather than against them to achieve a structured workflow, while maintaining excellent patient care and customer service. And as always, efficiency is key. When we talk about dental practice efficiency, it’s more than […]

        <p id="ai1" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article discusses strategies for improving efficiency in dental practices, focusing on innovative technologies and thoughtful surgical design. To boost workflow, it suggests eliminating repetitive setup tasks by allowing dentists to save their preferences across multiple treatment rooms. Enhanced intra-office communication is achieved through chairside apps that enable discreet messaging between team members.

Automation and streamlining waterline maintenance are addressed through hands-free flushing devices and timed flush settings on compatible delivery units, ensuring infection control while saving time. Ergonomics and operatory design are crucial for efficiency and reduced physical strain; well-designed treatment rooms facilitate smooth movement between procedures, while ambidextrous equipment caters to left- or right-handed dentists.

In shared spaces, flexibility is essential, with A-dec’s Radius® delivery systems supporting four-handed dentistry and streamlining setup, treatment, and clean-up. The design should account for patient and staff traffic flow, ensuring unobstructed access and storage of instruments and materials where they're needed. Lastly, the article emphasizes the importance of leveraging support from dental equipment manufacturers and suppliers when needed, and building long-term systems that support team workflow, patient experience, and overall success. Readers are encouraged to explore A-dec solutions on the Patterson Dental website and contact their local A-dec dealer or Territory Manager for more information.</p>

        <p id="ai2" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">SprintRay's Midas Digital Press, launched in 2024, revolutionized chairside crown printing with its innovative single-use capsule delivery system. Each capsule contains pre-measured resin for consistent results. However, as adoption grew, a concern arose about responsible disposal of used Midas capsules. To address this issue, SprintRay partnered with Dental Recycling North America (DRNA) to provide a disposal program for Midas users.

This partnership ensures dental offices comply with local, state, and federal hazardous waste regulations without the hassle of management. By working with DRNA, the industry leader in dental waste management, SprintRay simplifies the process for doctors to remain compliant while delivering advanced digital care.

The program, launching September 2025, includes labeled collection systems, prepaid return shipping, environmentally compliant processing, full documentation, and in-app reminders. These elements create a streamlined waste management solution that encourages proper disposal without disrupting workflows. Dental offices using Midas can now confidently dispose of resin capsules, focusing on delivering quality patient care. For more information and enrollment, visit www.drna.com/sprintray.</p>

Matthew Steele, director of state and local advocacy, discussed these issues on a podcast. The primary concerns include Medicaid cuts which could leave millions uninsured, and the increasing attention towards fluoride in water systems. To protect oral healthcare for vulnerable groups, leaders are engaging with stakeholder networks in affected states to develop strategies for future budget cycles. They aim to prevent negative health consequences seen in previous cutbacks, such as increased hospital admissions and treatment costs. Steele is encouraged by proactive policy responses at the state level regarding fluoride, particularly in Connecticut where a bill was introduced to protect safe levels of community water fluoridation. However, they are closely watching the impact of Medicaid cuts on various states' budgets for future years.</p>

        <p id="ai19" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Two recent studies suggest natural compounds derived from maple syrup and chamomile could aid in preventing tooth decay and cavities. Researchers at the University of Wyoming discovered that a compound found in maple syrup and green tea, epicatechin gallate (ECG), can inhibit sortase A, a protein produced by bacteria causing cavities. The study indicates that when sortase A is blocked, bacteria cannot stick to teeth and form cavities.

Another study published on ScienceDirect evaluated the antibacterial and anticariogenic effects of chamomile extract, finding that combining it with fluoride significantly reduced levels of Lactobacillus spp. and S. mutans, key contributors to dental caries. The study highlighted phytotherapy as a promising approach for cavity prevention, as chamomile contains antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and remineralizing properties.

These findings could lead to the development of safe and cost-effective alternatives for oral health products currently containing potentially toxic ingredients.</p>

        <p id="ai20" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article discusses two innovative approaches to aligner therapy that incorporate the Beneslider for distalisation, either through a two-phase or one-phase treatment process. Skeletal anchorage, particularly mini-implants in the anterior palate, has revolutionized orthodontic therapy due to reduced patient cooperation requirements and consistent results. The Beneslider and a newer screw mechanism distaliser are highlighted as efficient distalisation appliances, with the distaliser offering precise, controlled tooth movement but being bulkier, particularly for adult patients. A case study of a 35-year-old female patient who declined orthognathic surgery is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of these methods in correcting Class II molar relationships and overbite/overjet issues.</p>

The study found that while AI can aid diagnostics, it's prone to false negatives for subtle conditions like voids or early caries, underscoring its role as a support tool rather than replacement for human judgment.

Patient reactions were mixed; some appreciated robotics-assisted surgery, but others felt anxious due to the complexity of AI machinery. Compliance with AI monitoring tools decreased over time due to repetitive messages or frequent scans causing disengagement. User error in capturing intra-oral photographs also affected reliability.

The report revealed a lack of evidence regarding issues like equality, diversity, inclusion, and data protection despite the generation of large patient data volumes by AI systems. The authors suggest UK-specific research to address these concerns within the UK's cultural and social context.

In conclusion, the report acknowledges AI's potential in enhancing dental services but emphasizes that its practical application in daily practice is currently limited. Future studies are recommended to tackle clinical, regulatory, and ethical considerations, particularly focusing on patient safety and diverse patient needs. The full report can be accessed here.</p>
