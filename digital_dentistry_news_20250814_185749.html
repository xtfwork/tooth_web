        <p id="ai1" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article by Rosie Yacone, a Team Development Coach at Productive Dentist Academy, discusses the benefits of coaching in dental practices. She highlights that while talented teams can struggle to see the full picture due to working within the system every day, coaches bring fresh eyes and insights that numbers alone cannot reveal.

Yacone argues that coaching is not a luxury but a game plan for any practice, much like elite athletes, surgeons, or Fortune 500 executives rely on it. Good coaches don't impose canned playbooks; instead, they listen, observe, and co-create solutions tailored to the team's goals and potential.

The article emphasizes that coaches look beyond key performance indicators to uncover hidden issues, such as misalignments in treatment acceptance or patient care experiences. These minor inconsistencies can have significant impacts on production, care gaps, morale, and profitability.

Yacone concludes by stating that effective coaching relationships are not one-size-fits-all but tailored to the individual practice's vision, strengths, and culture. Connecting daily work to a shared purpose drives transformation, leading to measurable improvements in efficiency, productivity, and overall satisfaction.

The article ends with encouragement for dental practices to take the first step toward the practice they have always envisioned, emphasizing that coaches are ready to walk beside them on this journey.</p>

Key Learning Objectives:
1. Understanding indications for bonded bridges in dental restoration.
2. Mastering principles for the success of bonded bridge procedures.
3. Designing preparations for various circumstances on anterior and posterior teeth.
4. Techniques for temporizing and predictable bonded cementation with different restorative materials, including zirconia.</p>

        <p id="ai5" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Delta Dental's 2025 Original Tooth Fairy Poll, in its 27th year, revealed that 83% of homes across the country have been visited by the Tooth Fairy, an increase from 78% in 2024. The visit is considered one of children's favorite surprises and helps foster imagination (35%) and spread joy (30%). Nearly one-third of parents believe the Tooth Fairy helps instill good oral health habits.

The average value of a lost tooth declined by 14%, from $5.84 to $5.01, and the Tooth Fairy is giving fewer additional gifts (16%). Historically, the poll's findings mirrored the economy's overall direction, but since 2023, the value of a lost tooth has decreased while the S&P 500 increased.

The survey was conducted among 1,000 parents of children ages 6 to 12, and over $2.3 billion has been invested by Delta Dental companies and their foundations for oral health improvement in communities over the past 15 years.

        <p id="ai9" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Delta Dental of Wisconsin has acquired Cherry Tree Dental, sparking concerns within the dental community. The acquisition aims to ensure dental care access in rural areas of Wisconsin. However, dental providers are worried about potential conflicts of interest, as an insurer could now be both a provider and payer. The American Dental Association is investigating the deal's legal and regulatory implications. Delta Dental assures that Cherry Tree Dental practices will not be required to join its network, and it will not interfere with reimbursement negotiations or clinical decisions. Critics argue that such acquisitions could lead to cost-driven treatment recommendations, underpayment of staff, and a tiered system affecting the quality of care provided. The deal is seen as potentially shifting focus from patient health to financial efficiency.</p>

According to a recent report by TMJ4, the WDA believes that this merger could potentially lead to antitrust issues due to the dominance of Delta Dental in the market. Here are six key points:

1. The WDA has asked the state Department of Justice to carefully review Delta Dental's acquisition of dental practices.
2. The acquisition may create a dominant position for Delta Dental in the Wisconsin market, potentially leading to antitrust issues.
3. Delta Dental is already one of the largest providers of dental insurance in the state.
4. The WDA represents over 5,000 dentists and dental professionals across Wisconsin.
5. The acquisition could affect competition, pricing, and access to dental care for patients in the state.
6. The outcome of this review by the Department of Justice will have significant implications for the dental industry in Wisconsin.</p>

        <p id="ai14" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Researchers at King's College London have discovered a method to use keratin, a protein found in hair, skin, and wool, to repair tooth enamel and prevent decay. The study published in Advanced Healthcare Materials indicates that when applied to the tooth and combined with saliva minerals, keratin forms an enamel-like coating that grows stronger over time. This breakthrough could lead to a sustainable toothpaste or professional gel application within two to three years, offering potential benefits such as biodegradability, reduced reliance on toxic plastic resins, and a closer match to natural tooth color. The keratin is sustainably sourced from biological waste like hair and skin, making it an eco-friendly alternative in the field of regenerative dentistry. As concerns grow over healthcare sustainability and long-term fluoride use, this innovative approach represents a promising solution that adheres to circular economy principles by turning waste into a health-promoting resource.</p>

Marked by reduced tear and saliva production, the condition leads to dry mouth, tooth decay, and difficulty swallowing. A $2.1-million renewal grant from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), part of the NIH, has been awarded to Jill M. Kramer, a dental professor at the University at Buffalo, to continue research on MyD88, a key molecule in the immune system that plays a significant role in inflammation. Kramer's team is investigating how specific receptors activate MyD88 and its interaction in both patients and mice, focusing on toll-like receptors (TLRs). Their findings may lead to targeted therapies for Sjögren's disease and other autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The study aims to understand the disease progression and block key mediators of inflammation without compromising patients' immune systems.</p>

        <p id="ai16" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), enacted in July 2025, is a sweeping budget reconciliation law that significantly impacts the dental profession. Key provisions include tax benefits, such as the restoration of the pass-through entity tax deduction, a $40,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction for pass-through entities until 2030, and measures that allow practices to invest more in technology and infrastructure.

The act also addresses education and workforce issues by making post-secondary credentialing expenses eligible as higher-education costs, benefiting dental students. Additionally, it modifies employer-provided student loan repayment rules to exclude a portion of repayments from taxable income.

OBBB overhauls federal student loan programs beginning in July 2026, eliminating Graduate PLUS loans for new borrowers and introducing strict annual and lifetime borrowing caps. Medicaid changes between 2026 and 2028 could reduce adult dental services in some states due to funding adjustments, new co-pay allowances, and stricter eligibility rules.

Dentists should consult with tax professionals, financial aid offices, and state dental societies as they adapt their financial planning and advocacy efforts to this complex legislative change.</p>
