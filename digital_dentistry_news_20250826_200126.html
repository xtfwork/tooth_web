        <p id="ai1" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">MIDEC 2025, held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, provided a unique perspective on the global evolution of digital dentistry in emerging markets. Unlike international shows dominated by premium technologies and established brands, MIDEC showcased price-sensitivity as a key driver, with Chinese manufacturers predominantly shaping the digital dentistry landscape in these regions. The exhibition emphasized essential digital functionality at affordable prices, catering to dental practitioners who earn significantly less than their Western counterparts.

The most striking feature of MIDEC was the absence of large booths from industry leaders like 3Shape and exocad, replaced by simpler versions of premium solutions specifically designed for emerging markets. Companies such as Alliedstar, Shining 3D, and Runyes showcased their commitment to serving these markets with affordable digital workflows that include intraoral scanners, software, and supporting equipment.

The enthusiasm and engagement around digital solutions at MIDEC demonstrated the global nature of the digital revolution, happening at different speeds and price points but with the same ultimate destination - widespread digital dentistry adoption. The event highlighted that accessibility and affordability are reshaping who can participate in the digital transformation, opening new opportunities for companies to enter these markets.</p>

        <p id="ai7" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In this article, Alan Stern, a retired dentist and founder of Better, Richer, Stronger, LLC, discusses the concept of leadership in the dental office, applying it to every role within the team. Stern posits that everyone is capable of leadership, not just political or business figures often associated with the term. He suggests that leadership is a supportive conversation that fosters mutual growth and learning, emphasizing action.

Stern outlines four types of leaders in a dental office:

1. The Owner Dentist Leader creates a safe space, nurturing, illuminating, and acting as a true doctor by sharing knowledge generously, seeking input, and encouraging open communication.
2. The Associate, Hygienist, or Clinician Leader follows the same path, sharing knowledge and listening deeply with curiosity and compassion.
3. The Assistant Leader is a real-time leader in action, often seeing what the clinician can't, alerting them calmly and tactfully, building trust with patients through warmth and care.
4. The Administrative Leader, whose initial phone call sets the tone, navigates challenging conversations, and leads with empathy and clarity for better outcomes.
5. The Office Manager Leader serves as the glue, carrying the owner's vision, guiding the team, making decisions grounded in growth and action, and offering empowering feedback instead of punishment.

Stern concludes that when we view leadership as a means of supporting mutual growth and learning with a bias toward action, we improve not only our team but the entire dental profession.</p>

        <p id="ai11" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In 2025, the dental industry is experiencing significant trends in patient demand, dentist migration, and DSO growth. Middle-market DSOs are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to drive growth due to rising practice acquisition costs, while private equity investors are increasingly focusing on smaller DSOs at earlier stages. The healthcare sector continues to see steady job growth, with dental offices adding 7,100 employees in June alone. Oral surgery investment is increasing as more investors recognize the field's growth potential. Newer and younger dentists are delaying practice ownership after graduation due to demographic factors and educational debt. The American Association of Orthodontists also reported a decline in practice ownership among orthodontists, with more female and younger respondents joining DSOs as their first career opportunity.</p>

        <p id="ai16" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Dr. Krista Kappus, a dentist at Fitch Mountain Dental in Healdsburg, California, recently expressed concerns about the future of dentistry due to increasing costs and staffing issues. She highlighted the escalating costs of staffing, supplies, rent, and insurance reimbursements as major challenges for dental practices, fearing that they could not sustain these expenses without significant changes.

Kappus emphasized the need for reform in dental insurance, suggesting a return to simpler systems where dentists were directly reimbursed for services provided, instead of the current complex and burdensome process involving pre-authorization and multiple insurance companies. She also mentioned the lack of growth in dental hygiene programs over the past 20 years, which she believes is contributing to staffing shortages.

Kappus proposed considering expanded function dental assistants who could perform simple cleanings as a potential solution to the staffing crisis. She also advocated for dental education and insurance reform, questioning the feasibility of dentists repaying their high educational debts while earning modest salaries in the current system.</p>

        <p id="ai17" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article discusses the transformation of dentistry with the migration of dental services to the cloud, specifically focusing on the rise of AI-powered platforms and mobile apps. One such app, Trust AI, recently raised $6 million in seed funding, making it the largest early-stage investment in a dental technology startup. This funding, supported by industry players like Wehrle Implant Immersion Center, Goetze Dental, and Rockwood Programs, will help Trust AI expand its market reach and integrate with established practices.

Trust AI's platform aims to address common pain points in clinical work, offering diagnostic support, radiographic image analysis, insurance verification, patient communications, and practice management through a single portal compliant with healthcare privacy laws. The core of the platform is Isaac, a custom large language model designed for dentistry, which can be accessed anytime via web browser, voice call, or WhatsApp message.

With over 3,000 dentists registering within weeks of launch and approximately 500 new users each week, Trust AI shows promising growth without paid advertising, indicating strong word-of-mouth momentum. The app's anonymised clinical data helps improve Isaac's accuracy and relevance in real-world scenarios.

Co-founders aim to develop a fully AI-native practice management platform by 2026, automating workflows like note-taking, claims processing, and treatment plan generation. This goal is seen as a potential smartphone revolution for dentistry, reconfiguring both the operational aspect of practices and patient care experience.</p>

This partnership combines King's advanced training facilities and academic expertise with Ivoclar's course materials and logistical support. The programme offers dental students a global exchange of experience and hands-on training, enriching their learning beyond the classroom.

In 2025, the Ivoclar Summer School was held in nine locations worldwide, including the UK, Germany, India, China, Austria, Poland, Netherlands, Spain, and Liechtenstein, emphasizing the significance of cross-border collaboration in dental education.

Ivoclar CEO Markus Heinz views this initiative as an investment in future dentists, aiming to provide additional knowledge that complements traditional curriculums. The next edition is scheduled for 2026, with applications opening in early March on the Ivoclar website, and students can sign up for a waitlist.
