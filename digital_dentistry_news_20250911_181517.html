        <p id="ai5" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">At the 2025 Dykema DSO Conference, executives highlighted the significant challenge of insurance verification in dental support organizations (DSOs), hindering operational efficiency, revenue growth, and patient satisfaction. The American Dental Association reported that nationwide, dental claim rejections average 5-10%, leading to lost revenue, delayed collections, staff frustration, and reduced case acceptance.

Four key pain points were identified: manual work is unsustainable, trust beats speed, scaling presents hurdles, and patients are impacted by inaccurate or delayed insurance verification. To address these issues, Zuub, an AI-powered dental insurance verification provider, shared insights on how its solutions can help DSOs streamline their insurance verification processes while improving accuracy and efficiency.

Zuub's platform connects directly to payers, bypassing EDI clearinghouses to provide accurate coverage information. The data is standardized, AI-enhanced, and normalized across payers, making it easy for staff to use, automate, and trust. Zuub partners with the largest DSOs and dental technology platforms, reinforcing its role as a leader in driving the future of dental insurance verification. By reducing claim denials, improving collections, accelerating cash flow, and enhancing the patient experience, Zuub supports higher case acceptance and revenue growth for DSOs.</p>

        <p id="ai15" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In response to rising rates of chronic diseases and the health risks associated with excessive sugar consumption, China is implementing policy interventions to reduce free sugar intake. Dr Wu Jing, from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, emphasizes the importance of these measures in tackling chronic diseases due to their cost-effectiveness and root cause governance.

China's policy initiatives include the Three Reductions and Three Healthy Conditions campaign launched in 2017, which promotes healthy lifestyles, and the development of demonstration areas for comprehensive chronic disease prevention at county and district levels since 2010. The implementation of these campaigns has encouraged local governments to engage in sugar reduction efforts.

Cross-sectoral collaboration is crucial in reducing sugar consumption, with policy measures addressing challenges that cannot be resolved by single departments. For example, guidelines issued in 2021 by the National Health Commission, Ministry of Education, State Administration for Market Regulation, and General Administration of Sport prohibit high-sugar product sales at primary and secondary schools, making schools largely free from such products.

The local government in Shanghai encourages food producers to manufacture low-salt, low-fat, and low-sugar products with clear labeling, retailers to provide dedicated shelves for healthier options, and catering services to offer healthier meals with clear calorie and nutritional information. Despite limited data on the health outcomes of these policies, simulation studies suggest their potential impact in reducing sugar intake and related health conditions.

China's political commitment to public health is key to sustaining and expanding sugar reduction efforts. The Healthy China 2030 plan positions health promotion as a strategic priority for national development, offering support for related initiatives. The success of the salt reduction program in Shandong province serves as a valuable example for future sugar reduction efforts in China.</p>
