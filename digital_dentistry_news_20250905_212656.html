        <p id="ai11" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">ClearChoice Management Services has integrated artificial intelligence (AI) into its core operations to enhance patient care and practice efficiency. CEO Rahma Samow emphasizes that AI succeeds when it integrates seamlessly into existing workflows, solves meaningful problems for both patients and clinicians, and is used humanely to extend, rather than replace, human expertise.

In practice, AI is applied subtly to streamline patient communication, optimize marketing efforts, assist in treatment planning during consultations, and enhance operational efficiency in scheduling, consultation management, and patient flow. The results include faster access to care, improved clinical consistency, and more efficient workflows for clinicians and teams.

ClearChoice seeks further innovation in AI to streamline the entire implant dentistry treatment journey, integrate diagnostic imaging, surgical planning, and lab workflows into one seamless process, predict long-term outcomes based on patient data, and personalize outreach to prospective patients. However, Samow stresses that AI should always empower clinicians and not attempt to replace the human workforce.</p>

        <p id="ai13" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article discusses delays in dental care for children in Maine due to low reimbursements under the state's Medicaid program (MaineCare). Dr. Michael Dowling reported that children, including those requiring general anesthesia, are facing wait times of at least eight months. The Maine Dental Association estimates thousands of children in the state are currently waiting for dental treatment. The issue stems from MaineCare's failure to fully reimburse for the cost of anesthesia, causing financial loss for dentists. This has led many dentists to limit the number of MaineCare patients they treat. The Department of Health and Human Services announced a 1% increase in reimbursement rates this year, but any significant changes will have to wait until 2026, when the state's formal reform process is due.</p>

The editorial comes amidst discussions in several states about banning water fluoridation, with Utah and Florida recently becoming the first two states to prohibit the practice.

One notable development is the acquisition of several dental practices by Phase 1 Equity, a Chicago-based private equity firm specializing in the dental sector. This expansion reflects the growing interest of investment firms in the dental industry, offering opportunities for practice growth and modernization.

Secondly, Ohio State University's College of Dentistry has launched a new program aimed at addressing oral health disparities among underserved communities. The Community Oral Health Initiative will provide student-led dental clinics in these areas, aiming to improve accessibility and reduce oral health inequities.

Thirdly, the Ohio Dental Association (ODA) is urging dentists to be vigilant against insurance fraud. The ODA has reported an increase in suspicious claims, stressing the importance of proper documentation and reporting any suspected fraudulent activities to the appropriate authorities.

Lastly, a new dental technology company, VivaDent, has opened its doors in Ohio. This innovative firm specializes in 3D printing for dental applications, offering customized solutions for dentists across the state.

        <p id="ai19" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">A recent study published in Neurology suggests a link between sugar substitutes and faster cognitive decline. The research followed 12,772 adults over eight years, finding that six out of seven sweeteners were linked to a 62% faster decline in overall memory and thinking skills compared to the group with the least consumption. Only tagatose showed no association with cognitive decline. The study's author, Dr. Claudia Kimie Suemoto, noted that more research is needed to confirm these findings and investigate alternative sweeteners like applesauce, honey, or maple syrup. Despite being better for teeth and blood glucose levels, the new study raises concerns about heavy, long-term consumption of popular sweeteners potentially accelerating cognitive decline, particularly in people under 60 and those with diabetes.</p>

        <p id="ai20" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The UK government has announced a 12-week consultation to ban high-caffeine energy drinks for individuals under the age of 16, as part of its broader Plan for Change to enhance public health and resilience. This move has received support from dental professionals and public health bodies, who believe it will improve children's oral and overall health. The proposed ban covers all sales channels including shops, cafés, schools, vending machines, and online retailers.

The government argues that energy drinks can lead to poor sleep, reduced concentration, and childhood obesity, and estimates that this measure could potentially prevent obesity in up to 40,000 children and save tens of millions in healthcare costs. The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Wes Streeting, stated that energy drinks pose threats to children's health and well-being.

Dental professionals have welcomed the consultation but emphasize the need for broader reforms. They advocate for faster government action, mandatory manufacturing guidelines, and expanding the sugar levy to control unhealthy food and drink consumption among children. The ban is part of the government's wider Plan for Change addressing systemic healthcare challenges, including National Health Service dentistry. However, dental advocates have criticized the plan for lacking concrete commitments to dental services.

The energy drink ban represents a significant shift towards preventive health policy and is supported by dentists, though they stress that more extensive measures are required to address broader drivers of poor oral health. The consultation underscores a growing focus on prevention in both general health and addressing long-standing gaps in National Health Service dentistry provisions.</p>

        <p id="ai21" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Graphy, a pioneer in digital dentistry, has been officially listed on South Korea's KOSDAQ stock exchange following a successful initial public offering (IPO). The listing marks a significant step in the company's expansion into the global digital orthodontics sector, with strong investor interest reflecting confidence in its proprietary technology and growth potential. Funds raised from the IPO will be used to expand internationally, advance R&D in next-generation dental materials, and enhance manufacturing infrastructure.

In 2021, Graphy introduced its Shape Memory Aligner (SMA) at the International Dental Show in Cologne, Germany. The device, activated at human body temperature, aims to provide more precise and predictable tooth movement compared with conventional aligners. Industry experts view this listing as a testament to Graphy's leadership in digital dental technology and its potential for global expansion.

CEO Un-seob Sim stated that the KOSDAQ listing is the starting point for Graphy's mission to lead global innovation in digital dentistry. The company aims to strengthen its share of the international orthodontic market through clinical adoption and partnerships in Europe, the US, and Asia. In August, Graphy sponsored and participated in the EAS North America Aligner Forum, aiming to strengthen its presence in the US market.</p>
