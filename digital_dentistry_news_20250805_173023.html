        <p id="ai3" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Henry Schein, a prominent dental supplies company, reported $872 million in U.S. dental sales for Q2 2025, marking a 2.1% decrease from the same period in 2024. The reduction is highlighted in the company's Aug. 5 financial report.

Five key points to note:
1. Despite the decrease, total revenue for the quarter reached $3.8 billion, an increase of 0.7%.
2. Operating income decreased by 6.4% to $329 million.
3. Net earnings were $235 million, a 17.2% decrease from the previous year.
4. Earnings per share (EPS) declined by 18.3% to $0.59.
5. The company attributed the sales decline to factors such as increased competition and pandemic-related disruptions in dental practices. Despite this, they remain optimistic about future growth opportunities with the ongoing recovery of dental markets.</p>

        <p id="ai5" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">This study investigates the addition of zwitterionic substances, specifically MPC, into clear aligner polymers to inhibit biofilm formation while preserving mechanical properties. The findings suggest that MPC addition did not significantly affect creep and stress relaxation but showed non-linearity in its effect on mechanical strength and elastic modulus. Previous studies have shown that high concentrations of zwitterions can negatively impact mechanical properties, but this study found that up to 3 wt% MPC had no significant effect on resin strength. Additionally, the study found a significant reduction in protein adsorption with the addition of MPC, suggesting reduced biofilm formation. The optimal concentration for effective anti-biofouling while preserving mechanical characteristics was found to be 3 wt% of MPC. However, this study has limitations such as lack of long-term stability testing and use of a single bacterial strain, and future studies should explore water absorption, thermocycling, and combination with other functional properties to enhance clinical applicability.</p>

        <p id="ai6" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The study "3D printed tooth for endodontic training in dental education," published in Scientific Reports on June 20, 2025, found that 3D-printed teeth were considered more suitable than acrylic blocks for practice and handling by students due to their realistic root canal anatomy, consistency, hygienic advantages, and lower cost. However, they were rated slightly less realistic and not as suitable for comprehensive training compared to natural teeth.

The study showed that the use of 3D-printed teeth increased students' motivation to improve their endodontic skills. Over three-quarters of students expressed interest in additional exercises with these models.

While acknowledging certain limitations, the researchers concluded that 3D-printed practice teeth provide a cost-effective, reproducible, and anatomically realistic alternative to acrylic blocks and natural tooth models for dental training. They suggested further enhancements, such as varying anatomies, tactile features, or simulated soft tissue, could improve the printed models' realism and close the gap with natural teeth.</p>
