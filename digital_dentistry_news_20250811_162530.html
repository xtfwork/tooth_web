Dental care is an important part of your patients’ health, but patients might forgo seeking necessary dental care due to the costs involved. One way your office can help with concerns around cost is by offering payment financing options. These allow patients to spread out payments so that the price of treatment doesn’t hit all […]

        <p id="ai1" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article discusses the importance of dental care affordability for patients and suggests offering payment financing options as a solution. These options enable patients to pay for treatment over time instead of a single large payment, making it more manageable financially. This can improve patient experience by reducing stress associated with large bills, and increase the likelihood of them returning for future care.

For dental practices, implementing these financing options offers several benefits: it ensures steady cash flow, reduces paperwork related to unpaid invoices and delayed payments, and simplifies administrative processes through modern platforms designed for coordinating payment plans. Offering flexible financing options not only supports patient care but also contributes to a practice's long-term success. The article encourages readers to visit a specified website for more information on implementing such payment solutions in their practices.</p>

        <p id="ai2" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">This article announces a free Continuing Education (CE) webinar scheduled for August 21 at 8 PM Eastern Time. The webinar, delivered by Dr. Ruiz, focuses on the next generation of bonded bridges in dentistry.

Traditionally, dental implants have been favored due to their perceived minimal invasiveness and durability. However, after four decades of use, it has become evident that dental implants are not always less invasive or problem-free.

Dr. Ruiz will discuss the indications for using bonded bridges, success principles, prep designs for various anterior and posterior teeth scenarios, and techniques for temporizing and predictable bonded cementation of different restorative materials, including zirconia. The course aims to equip attendees with valuable knowledge about the latest advancements in adhesives, porcelains, and manufacturing techniques that have improved the performance and aesthetic appeal of bonded bridges.</p>

        <p id="ai3" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In an article for Dentistry Today, veteran cosmetic dentistry practice management consultant Harvey N. Silverman offers advice to expand a dental practice's cosmetic dentistry services within 48 hours. The approach emphasizes patient education through the use of a team-centered system called TIMS (Team Impact Multiplier System), which helps uncover latent demand for cosmetic dentistry in patients who may not have expressed interest previously. The system is based on the understanding that many patients have anxieties about cost, discomfort, and other factors related to cosmetic dentistry. Silverman argues that these concerns can be addressed with a new paradigm shift in communication, making it easier for both dentists and patients to take advantage of the high latent demand for cosmetic dentistry services. The series will provide action steps for implementing this system into daily practice regimens, with the goal of increasing the number of cosmetic dentistry cases performed by dentists.</p>

        <p id="ai4" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Xlear Inc., a company renowned for its xylitol-based nasal and oral care products, including the popular brand Spry, celebrated its 25th anniversary this year. Founded by Dr. Alonzo (Lon) Jones in the late 1990s, Xlear was born from a quest to find natural solutions for persistent upper respiratory infections.

Dr. Jones, a family medicine physician and author, discovered the benefits of xylitol - a natural sweetener derived from various sources - and found success in reducing recurring ear infections among his patients. Inspired by Finnish studies on xylitol's effects and its scientific impact, he developed the first saline nasal spray with xylitol.

In 2000, Dr. Jones' son, Nathan Jones, bottled this successful formula to make it accessible to all, leading to the creation of Xlear Nasal Spray. In 2002, he launched Spry, a dental defense line dedicated to xylitol-based oral hygiene products for families. Today, Xlear is a pioneer and leader in the field of xylitol-based nasal and oral hygiene products.

Xylitol offers numerous health benefits, such as blocking bacterial and viral adhesion in the nasal passages, reducing inflammation, stimulating natural defense systems, hydrating nasal and sinus passages, reducing cavity-causing bacteria in the mouth, and increasing saliva production to protect and repair teeth.

As Xlear marks its 25th anniversary, it remains committed to improving lives through natural and effective hygiene products, focusing on innovation and science-backed ingredients. The company is available in major retail stores like CVS, Walgreens, Target, and local pharmacies and retailers. For more information, visit xlear.com.</p>

Changes include limiting live continuing education courses, transitioning many events to virtual formats, reducing marketing spending, and cutting staff positions.

        <p id="ai18" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">A study led by researchers from the University of California, Irvine, in collaboration with Japanese universities, has discovered the biological process behind chitons' ability to grow teeth harder than human enamel. This groundbreaking research sheds light on the mechanisms of precise, nanoscale mineral formation within the teeth and presents opportunities for the development of environmentally friendly and sustainable materials such as batteries, fuel cell catalysts, semiconductors, and 3D printing.

The team found that chiton-specific iron-binding proteins (RTMP1) are transported via nanoscale tubules into the forming teeth, where they bind with chitin nanofiber scaffolds and iron stored in ferritin. This binding guides the deposition of magnetite nanorods that give the teeth extraordinary hardness, stiffness, and magnetic properties. The research was published in Science and received funding from the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the Army Research Office.

Chitons are a type of marine mollusk, with over 900 species mostly found in intertidal coastal regions. The species studied in this research are larger and inhabit the northwest coast of the United States and off Hokkaido, Japan. This collaboration between biological and materials science has provided insights into one of Earth's hardest and strongest biological materials.</p>

        <p id="ai19" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In a study titled "Assessing ChatGPT's suitability in responding to the public's inquiries on the effects of smoking on oral health," researchers evaluated the effectiveness of ChatGPT 3.5 in providing reliable information about tobacco use and its impact on oral health.

The team, consisting of members from the University of Jordan and the Kuwait Ministry of Health, generated a pool of 119 commonly asked questions related to periodontal conditions, teeth, oral hygiene, surgery, and other oral health concerns. Responses were assessed based on usefulness, readability, quality, reliability, and actionability.

Most responses were deemed either very useful (36.1%) or useful (42.0%), of moderate to good quality (78.2%). However, only 23.5% of responses scored highly in terms of actionability and 35.3% were moderately easy to read. The tool's performance varied across topics, with less effective responses provided for specialized topics like the effects of tobacco use on oral soft tissue and oral surgeries.

The study highlights that while ChatGPT is useful for providing general information about the impact of tobacco use on oral health, it faces challenges in readability, consistency, and quality when addressing more detailed questions or specialized topics. The authors emphasize that while this technology can supplement healthcare education, it should not replace professional dental advice.

The study was published online on 19 July 2025 in BMC Oral Health.</p>
