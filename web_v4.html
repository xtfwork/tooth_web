This tool generates a personalized checklist for each patient, including treatment needs, follow-ups, and business opportunities, before the dental appointment even begins.

DentScribe has been revolutionizing dental documentation by using AI to create accurate SOAP notes from dentist-patient conversations without the need for typing. CoPilot takes it a step further, reviewing each note and providing a dynamic checklist of next steps and clinical reminders within the DentScribe app during care delivery.

CoPilot's AI is trained to spot leading indicators that can make a significant difference in both patient care and practice growth. For instance, if a patient mentions crowding or clenching, CoPilot will highlight this at the next visit and prompt the dentist to discuss potential treatments like Invisalign or a nightguard.

DentScribe CoPilot improves patient care by ensuring no critical details are overlooked, enhances documentation with consistent SOAP notes, offers a seamless user experience within the DentScribe app, and boosts revenue by identifying missed opportunities. It transforms every SOAP note into a smart clinical and business assistant, allowing dentists to educate patients effectively while driving additional revenue and delivering better personalized care.

DentScribe CoPilot is now available nationwide as part of DentScribe's subscription. Interested dentists can book a demo at www.dentscribe.ai/book-a-demo to explore how AI can optimize their practice.</p>

The floss includes molecularly imprinted polymer structures, a graphene-based electrode substrate, and thread microfluidics for high sensitivity. The capillary action of the floss transports saliva into a flexible electrochemical sensor for cortisol level analysis. The dental floss provides results within 12 minutes and shows consistent accuracy, making it cost-effective and easy to use. This could increase adherence to at-home stress testing. The study validated the floss using human saliva samples, demonstrating a high correlation with conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The authors suggest that this dental floss could simplify stress level monitoring and have potential applications for identifying other salivary biomarkers related to mental health issues, inflammation, or metabolic diseases.

In a New York Times article, experts affirm that dental X-rays are safe, exposing patients to low levels of radiation, even less than environmental exposure. Erika Benavides, D.D.S., Ph.D., an oral and maxillofacial radiologist at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry, led a panel convened by the ADA Council on Scientific Affairs that published safety guidelines in 2024.

Before administering X-rays, dental professionals should conduct clinical examinations to determine their necessity. X-rays are crucial for identifying oral health issues, such as dental caries, cysts or tumors, gum disease, and bone loss. Although ionizing radiation can cause DNA damage and increase cancer risk, dental X-rays expose patients to very low levels.

Recent updates in recommendations from the ADA and American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology (AAOMR) state that protective aprons and thyroid-protecting collars are no longer required during dental X-rays. Both organizations also confirm the safety of dental X-rays for pregnant women and their fetuses, exposing them to levels up to 30,000 times lower than harmful levels. For instance, bitewing and panoramic X-rays expose patients to about five and 20 microsieverts of radiation, respectively. The experts emphasized that these levels have significantly decreased compared to levels three decades ago.

The article serves to inform the broader media perspective on dentistry, although its content does not necessarily align with the ADA's stance, and its publication does not imply endorsement or agreement.</p>

A study published in Clinical Oral Implants Research compared this AI-approach with traditional human intelligence methods for single posterior mandibular tooth replacement. Using 50 cone-beam computed tomography and intraoral scans, the researchers found that while both approaches offered clinically acceptable implant planning, the AI model was more efficient in reducing planning time and showed greater consistency compared to dental professionals. The study suggests that the novel AI-based approach could potentially improve implant placement precision and efficiency.

The study, published in The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry, suggests that these technologies could enhance precision and minimize invasiveness in surgery.

The mixed reality strategy involves a tablet display with registration software, while the augmented reality strategy is designed for a head-mounted display. While the former may require continuous re-registration and could be affected by surgical light, the latter allows clinicians to access patient data conveniently. However, the head-mounted display might disconnect clinicians from their surroundings.

The study indicates that these technologies could potentially reduce iatrogenic damage and increase accuracy in dental implant placement. While the findings are promising, further optimization of mixed reality technology is needed before its widespread clinical implementation.

The American Dental Association (ADA) has published several standards and white papers on this topic, including the first U.S. standard on AI in dentistry.

ADA White Paper No. 1106:2022 provides an overview of AI uses in various dental disciplines, addressing both clinical and non-clinical aspects such as payer topics and regulatory environment. ADA Technical Report No. 1109:2025 emphasizes the need for an independent dataset to validate AI algorithms used to analyze 2D dental images for accuracy and specificity.

ADA's ANSI/ADA Standard No. 1110-1:2025 offers criteria for annotating and collecting data from 2D radiographs, aiding in clinical decision-making and image analysis associated with machine learning and deep learning. The proposed ISO 18374 document aims to define requirements for developing AI software used for 2D radiograph analysis, outlining the goals, limitations, and target end-users.

Overall, these standards provide dentists with a roadmap for evaluating and integrating AI systems responsibly, ensuring safety, efficacy, transparency, and fairness in their application. The ADA encourages dentists to stay informed about best practices and established standards in AI usage.</p>

Using computer-aided design and 3D printing, the researchers provided three types of appliances to participants, each utilizing one of the three tracking methods.

For static occlusion, the optical tracking devices demonstrated the lowest discrepancy in contact points at maximal intercuspation position, followed by conventional tracking devices and average articulator values. Both tracking devices also showed lower discrepancies compared to average articulator values at the final protrusive position, with optical tracking devices significantly reducing anterior open bite. For dynamic occlusion, optical tracking devices performed better and had no interferences during protrusive movement.

The study suggests that optical tracking devices may enhance treatment efficacy and clinical outcomes in these patients. However, it's important to note that the publication of an article does not imply endorsement or agreement with its content by the American Dental Association.</p>

dentistry for diagnosing and planning treatment for a variety of oral diseases
with the ability to produce detailed, three-dimensional images of the teeth,
jawbones, and surrounding structures. CBCT imaging has emerged as an essential
diagnostic tool in dentistry. CBCT imaging has seen significant improvements in
terms of its diagnostic value, as well as its accuracy and efficiency, with the
most recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This paper
reviews recent AI trends and practices in dental CBCT imaging. AI has been used
for lesion detection, malocclusion classification, measurement of buccal bone
thickness, and classification and segmentation of teeth, alveolar bones,
mandibles, landmarks, contours, and pharyngeal airways using CBCT images.
Mainly machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms, and
super-resolution techniques are used for these tasks. This review focuses on
the potential of AI techniques to transform CBCT imaging in dentistry, which
would improve both diagnosis and treatment planning. Finally, we discuss the
challenges and limitations of artificial intelligence in dentistry and CBCT
imaging.</p>

artificial intelligence is anticipated to play a significant role in digital
dentistry. AI holds the potential to significantly assist dental practitioners
and elevate diagnostic accuracy. In alignment with this vision, the 2023 MICCAI
DENTEX challenge aims to enhance the performance of dental panoramic X-ray
diagnosis and enumeration through technological advancement. In response, we
introduce DETDet, a Dual Ensemble Teeth Detection network. DETDet encompasses
two distinct modules dedicated to enumeration and diagnosis. Leveraging the
advantages of teeth mask data, we employ Mask-RCNN for the enumeration module.
For the diagnosis module, we adopt an ensemble model comprising DiffusionDet
and DINO. To further enhance precision scores, we integrate a complementary
module to harness the potential of unlabeled data. The code for our approach
will be made accessible at https://github.com/Bestever-choi/Evident</p>

applications in digital dentistry. However, constructing an unbiased dental
template and accurate parametric dental models remains a challenging task due
to the complex anatomical and morphological dental structures and also low
volume ratio of the teeth. In this study, we develop an unbiased dental
template by constructing an accurate dental atlas from CBCT images with
guidance of teeth segmentation. First, to address the challenges, we propose to
enhance the CBCT images and their segmentation images, including image
cropping, image masking and segmentation intensity reassigning. Then, we
further use the segmentation images to perform co-registration with the CBCT
images to generate an accurate dental atlas, from which an unbiased dental
template can be generated. By leveraging the unbiased dental template, we
construct parametric dental models by estimating point-to-point correspondences
between the dental models and employing Principal Component Analysis to
determine shape subspaces of the parametric dental models. A total of 159 CBCT
images of real subjects are collected to perform the constructions.
Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed method in
constructing unbiased dental template and parametric dental model. The
developed dental template and parametric dental models are available at

  Panoramic X-ray</a><br>

originally reside in the cone-beam CT (CBCT), from a single 2D Panoramic
X-ray(PX) remains a critical yet challenging task, as it can effectively reduce
radiation risks and treatment costs during the diagnostic in digital dentistry.
However, current methods are either error-prone or only trained/evaluated on
small-scale datasets (less than 50 cases), resulting in compromised
trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose PX2Tooth, a novel approach to
reconstruct 3D teeth using a single PX image with a two-stage framework. First,
we design the PXSegNet to segment the permanent teeth from the PX images,
providing clear positional, morphological, and categorical information for each
tooth. Subsequently, we design a novel tooth generation network (TGNet) that
learns to transform random point clouds into 3D teeth. TGNet integrates the
segmented patch information and introduces a Prior Fusion Module (PFM) to
enhance the generation quality, especially in the root apex region. Moreover,
we construct a dataset comprising 499 pairs of CBCT and Panoramic X-rays.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PX2Tooth can achieve an Intersection
over Union (IoU) of 0.793, significantly surpassing previous methods,
underscoring the great potential of artificial intelligence in digital
dentistry.</p>

  Spectral Embeddings</a><br>
                            <small style="color: #333;">Tibor Kubík, François Guibault, Michal Španěl, Hervé Lombaert | 2025-06-03T09:56:22Z</small><br>
                            <p id="abs26" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">We introduce ToothForge, a spectral approach for automatically generating
novel 3D teeth, effectively addressing the sparsity of dental shape datasets.
By operating in the spectral domain, our method enables compact machine
learning modeling, allowing the generation of high-resolution tooth meshes in
milliseconds. However, generating shape spectra comes with the instability of
the decomposed harmonics. To address this, we propose modeling the latent
manifold on synchronized frequential embeddings. Spectra of all data samples
are aligned to a common basis prior to the training procedure, effectively
eliminating biases introduced by the decomposition instability. Furthermore,
synchronized modeling removes the limiting factor imposed by previous methods,
which require all shapes to share a common fixed connectivity. Using a private
dataset of real dental crowns, we observe a greater reconstruction quality of
the synthetized shapes, exceeding those of models trained on unaligned
embeddings. We also explore additional applications of spectral analysis in
digital dentistry, such as shape compression and interpolation. ToothForge
facilitates a range of approaches at the intersection of spectral analysis and
machine learning, with fewer restrictions on mesh structure. This makes it
applicable for shape analysis not only in dentistry, but also in broader
medical applications, where guaranteeing consistent connectivity across shapes
from various clinics is unrealistic. The code is available at
https://github.com/tiborkubik/toothForge.</p>

as the social sciences. The metaphor comprises four dimensions: (a) Discipline
Self-dependence, (b) Knowledge Exports/Imports, (c) Scientific Trading
Dynamics, and (d) Scientific Trading Impact. This framework is applied to a
dataset of 221 Web of Science subject categories. We find that: (i) the
Scientific Trading Impact and Dynamics of Materials Science And Transportation
Science have increased; (ii) Biomedical Disciplines, Physics, And Mathematics
are significant knowledge exporters, as is Statistics & Probability; (iii) in
the social sciences, Economics, Business, Psychology, Management, And Sociology
are important knowledge exporters; (iv) Discipline Self-dependence is
associated with specialized domains which have ties to professional practice
(e.g., Law, Ophthalmology, Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine, Psychology,
Psychoanalysis, Veterinary Sciences, And Nursing).</p>

articles in the field of Dentistry. We present two case studies in which we
critically examine the contents and context that motivate the tweeting of
journal articles. We then focus on a specific aspect, the role played by
journals on self-promoting their contents and the effect this has on the total
number of tweets their papers produce. In a context where many are pushing to
the use of altmetrics as an alternative or complement to traditional
bibliometric indicators. We find a lack of evidence (and interest) on
critically examining the many claims that are being made as to their capability
to trace evidences of 'broader forms of impact'. Our first results are not
promising and question current approaches being made in the field of
altmetrics.</p>

  productivity</a><br>

research funding bodies, scientific entities and government agencies. In this
study, we investigate whether text features extracted from projects title and
abstracts are able to identify productive grants. Our analysis was conducted in
three distinct areas, namely Medicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Medicine.
Topical and complexity text features were used to identify predictors of
productivity. The results indicate that there is a statistically significant
relationship between text features and grants productivity, however such a
dependence is weak. A feature relevance analysis revealed that the abstract
text length and metrics derived from lexical diversity are among the most
discriminative features. We also found that the prediction accuracy has a
dependence on the considered project language and that topical features are
more discriminative than text complexity measurements. Our findings suggest
that text features should be used in combination with other features to assist
the identification of relevant research ideas.</p>

vision, such as object tracking and recognition, security, military, and
biomedical image analysis. This review presents the application of
convolutional neural networks in one of the fields of dentistry - orthodontics.
Advances in medical imaging technologies and methods allow CNNs to be used in
orthodontics to shorten the planning time of orthodontic treatment, including
an automatic search of landmarks on cephalometric X-ray images, tooth
segmentation on Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images or digital models,
and classification of defects on X-Ray panoramic images. In this work, we
describe the current methods, the architectures of deep convolutional neural
networks used, and their implementations, together with a comparison of the
results achieved by them. The promising results and visualizations of the
described studies show that the use of methods based on convolutional neural
networks allows for the improvement of computer-based orthodontic treatment
planning, both by reducing the examination time and, in many cases, by
performing the analysis much more accurately than a manual orthodontist does.</p>
