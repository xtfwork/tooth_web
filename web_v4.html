These legacy systems may have served dental service organizations (DSOs) in the past, but they now hinder growth, disrupt workflow, and fall short of meeting the needs of modern DSOs, their teams, and patients—all of which are a major roadblock to increasing profitability.  For DSOs to achieve profitability and growth in 2025, it's time to challenge old assumptions and embrace new approaches that improve efficiency and patient engagement. Here are three powerful strategies to help DSOs move beyond outdated practices and adopt forward-thinking solutions that will add more to your bottom line. 1.

Author: Eric Giesecke, CEO of Planet DDS

In an outdated dental industry, dental service organizations (DSOs) are hindered by legacy systems that disrupt workflow and fall short of meeting modern demands. To achieve growth and profitability in 2025, three key strategies can help DSOs move beyond these practices:

1. Open API and Integrated Tech Ecosystem Approach: A connected ecosystem addresses the pain points caused by disconnected systems, leading to increased efficiency, productivity, and patient satisfaction. With APIs, DSOs have the flexibility to choose custom solutions based on their needs without being confined to one system's limitations.

2. Data-Driven Decision Making: To harness data’s potential, DSOs should adopt platforms with powerful analytics that integrate data across multiple systems, empowering them to make proactive decisions and drive actionable insights. This can lead to significant improvements in the bottom line by identifying patterns in no-shows and implementing automated reminders, among other efficiencies.

3. Prioritize Patient Experience: A focus on the patient journey from appointment scheduling to post-visit follow-ups leads to higher retention and referrals. An open API platform enables a holistic view of the journey, resulting in streamlined workflows, increased productivity, and loyal patients.

In conclusion, DSOs must adopt modern approaches that leverage open technology, data insights, and patient-centered service to improve operational efficiency, stay competitive, and unlock new levels of healthy cash flow.</p>

A survey was conducted among second- (pre-D2 and post-D2), first- (D1, negative control), third-, and fourth-year dental students (D3 and D4, positive controls). Only OSU College of Dentistry students who completed the activity and completed the surveys were included. Seven questions were rated, which evaluated changes in knowledge, skill, interest, the importance of technology availability in an office, patients’ perception of technology, the importance of having the technology, and the expected frequency of clinics utilizing the technology. Statistical analysis was performed with a significance level of 0.05. A total of 74 pre-D2 and 77 post-D2 questionnaires were completed. Additionally, 63 D1, 43 D3, and 39 D4 participants responded to the survey. Significant differences were found for “knowledge” and “skill” between the pre-D2 and post-D2 and pre-D2 and control groups (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference between the post-D2 participants and all the controls in terms of “interest” (p = 0.0127) and preference for in-practice technology availability (p < 0.05). There were significant results between the post-D2 participants and all the controls regarding the importance of technology availability in an office (p < 0.001) and the expected frequency of clinics utilizing the technology (p = 0.01). No significance was found for “value of technology to patients” and “the importance of having the technology”. The presence of technology in practice and in educational academic environments significantly improved students’ interest and perception of their knowledge and skill.</p>

In the past, taking dental impression, making dental models, and assembling dental laboratory prostheses took a lot of time. However, the advent of the intraoral scanner, digital radiography, computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), 3D printers, and artificial intelligence (AI) software revolutionized the field of dentistry as we know it today.1–3 Precision and accuracy are two of digital dentistry’s key benefits. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and digital radiography are two examples of digital imaging technologies that enable dentists to get extremely precise and detailed pictures of the teeth and surrounding tissues.3 The utilization of these data allows for very precise and predictable treatment planning and execution. The effectiveness and quickness with which dental restorations may be made is another advantage of digital dentistry. With the use of CAD/CAM technology, dental restorations may be designed and created in a single session, doing away with the need for further visits and interim restorations.4 Increased precision and accuracy, quicker production times, and more personalization options are all benefits of digital dentures. They also eliminate the requirement for traditional impression materials, which some patients could find painful.5 Due to their reduced waste generation and resource usage, digital dentures may also be more ecologically friendly than conventional ones.</p>

It became essential for dental practitioners to be well-informed about this technology to improve the quality of care offered and increase patient satisfaction. This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, awareness, and perception of Egyptian dentists toward digital dentistry. Methods An online-based cross-sectional study was conducted using social media platforms from November 2022 to March 2023. Our study sample included dentists with different levels of experience, specialties, and working in different health sectors in Egypt. A questionnaire arranged in 4 sections and 23 questions was used as the study data collection tool. The data were tabulated and analyzed using SPSS software. Results A total of 402 participants filled out this questionnaire. 50.7% of which were females, 42.8% were between 20–29 years old and 42.3% were general practitioners. Furthermore, the main practice of 27.6% was in governmental dental clinics. Moreover, 47.3% and 64.2% of participants had Moderate knowledge and awareness respectively. While 75.9% of them had a high perception of practicing digital dentistry. Females and practitioners in governmental clinics had significantly lower awareness scores, while faculty teaching staff had significantly higher scores ( P  ≤ 0.05). On the other hand, practicing in the Great Cairo region and urban areas was associated with significantly higher knowledge scores ( P  ≤ 0.05). Similarly, Prosthodontists, periodontists, and restorative dentists had significantly higher scores when compared with general dentists ( P  ≤ 0.05). Conclusions About half of the study participants had Moderate knowledge and awareness levels, while about three-quarters of them had a high level of perception toward practicing digital dentistry. Therefore, more attention should be given to providing dental education programs in this important field at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels by policymakers.</p>

However, the literature on its effectiveness remains controversial, and a systematic review and meta-analysis are necessary to evaluate the available evidence. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple online databases using MeSH keywords and Boolean operators. Data extraction was performed, and a bias assessment was conducted based on modified CONSORT guidelines. The pooled odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were then calculated. Five studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall analysis showed no statistically significant difference in the accuracy of implant placement and prosthesis fabrication between digital and conventional techniques (OR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.23 and RR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.23). Subgroup analysis based on individual studies did not demonstrate consistent results. This review suggests that digital techniques do not significantly impact the accuracy of implant placement and prosthesis fabrication compared to conventional techniques in an in vitro setting. However, the overall evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the heterogeneity observed. Future well-designed studies, including randomized controlled trials and clinical studies, are needed to provide more robust evidence on the effectiveness of digital dentistry in clinical practice.</p>

dentistry for diagnosing and planning treatment for a variety of oral diseases
with the ability to produce detailed, three-dimensional images of the teeth,
jawbones, and surrounding structures. CBCT imaging has emerged as an essential
diagnostic tool in dentistry. CBCT imaging has seen significant improvements in
terms of its diagnostic value, as well as its accuracy and efficiency, with the
most recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This paper
reviews recent AI trends and practices in dental CBCT imaging. AI has been used
for lesion detection, malocclusion classification, measurement of buccal bone
thickness, and classification and segmentation of teeth, alveolar bones,
mandibles, landmarks, contours, and pharyngeal airways using CBCT images.
Mainly machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms, and
super-resolution techniques are used for these tasks. This review focuses on
the potential of AI techniques to transform CBCT imaging in dentistry, which
would improve both diagnosis and treatment planning. Finally, we discuss the
challenges and limitations of artificial intelligence in dentistry and CBCT
imaging.</p>

artificial intelligence is anticipated to play a significant role in digital
dentistry. AI holds the potential to significantly assist dental practitioners
and elevate diagnostic accuracy. In alignment with this vision, the 2023 MICCAI
DENTEX challenge aims to enhance the performance of dental panoramic X-ray
diagnosis and enumeration through technological advancement. In response, we
introduce DETDet, a Dual Ensemble Teeth Detection network. DETDet encompasses
two distinct modules dedicated to enumeration and diagnosis. Leveraging the
advantages of teeth mask data, we employ Mask-RCNN for the enumeration module.
For the diagnosis module, we adopt an ensemble model comprising DiffusionDet
and DINO. To further enhance precision scores, we integrate a complementary
module to harness the potential of unlabeled data. The code for our approach
will be made accessible at https://github.com/Bestever-choi/Evident</p>

applications in digital dentistry. However, constructing an unbiased dental
template and accurate parametric dental models remains a challenging task due
to the complex anatomical and morphological dental structures and also low
volume ratio of the teeth. In this study, we develop an unbiased dental
template by constructing an accurate dental atlas from CBCT images with
guidance of teeth segmentation. First, to address the challenges, we propose to
enhance the CBCT images and their segmentation images, including image
cropping, image masking and segmentation intensity reassigning. Then, we
further use the segmentation images to perform co-registration with the CBCT
images to generate an accurate dental atlas, from which an unbiased dental
template can be generated. By leveraging the unbiased dental template, we
construct parametric dental models by estimating point-to-point correspondences
between the dental models and employing Principal Component Analysis to
determine shape subspaces of the parametric dental models. A total of 159 CBCT
images of real subjects are collected to perform the constructions.
Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed method in
constructing unbiased dental template and parametric dental model. The
developed dental template and parametric dental models are available at

  Panoramic X-ray</a><br>

originally reside in the cone-beam CT (CBCT), from a single 2D Panoramic
X-ray(PX) remains a critical yet challenging task, as it can effectively reduce
radiation risks and treatment costs during the diagnostic in digital dentistry.
However, current methods are either error-prone or only trained/evaluated on
small-scale datasets (less than 50 cases), resulting in compromised
trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose PX2Tooth, a novel approach to
reconstruct 3D teeth using a single PX image with a two-stage framework. First,
we design the PXSegNet to segment the permanent teeth from the PX images,
providing clear positional, morphological, and categorical information for each
tooth. Subsequently, we design a novel tooth generation network (TGNet) that
learns to transform random point clouds into 3D teeth. TGNet integrates the
segmented patch information and introduces a Prior Fusion Module (PFM) to
enhance the generation quality, especially in the root apex region. Moreover,
we construct a dataset comprising 499 pairs of CBCT and Panoramic X-rays.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PX2Tooth can achieve an Intersection
over Union (IoU) of 0.793, significantly surpassing previous methods,
underscoring the great potential of artificial intelligence in digital
dentistry.</p>

as the social sciences. The metaphor comprises four dimensions: (a) Discipline
Self-dependence, (b) Knowledge Exports/Imports, (c) Scientific Trading
Dynamics, and (d) Scientific Trading Impact. This framework is applied to a
dataset of 221 Web of Science subject categories. We find that: (i) the
Scientific Trading Impact and Dynamics of Materials Science And Transportation
Science have increased; (ii) Biomedical Disciplines, Physics, And Mathematics
are significant knowledge exporters, as is Statistics & Probability; (iii) in
the social sciences, Economics, Business, Psychology, Management, And Sociology
are important knowledge exporters; (iv) Discipline Self-dependence is
associated with specialized domains which have ties to professional practice
(e.g., Law, Ophthalmology, Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine, Psychology,
Psychoanalysis, Veterinary Sciences, And Nursing).</p>

articles in the field of Dentistry. We present two case studies in which we
critically examine the contents and context that motivate the tweeting of
journal articles. We then focus on a specific aspect, the role played by
journals on self-promoting their contents and the effect this has on the total
number of tweets their papers produce. In a context where many are pushing to
the use of altmetrics as an alternative or complement to traditional
bibliometric indicators. We find a lack of evidence (and interest) on
critically examining the many claims that are being made as to their capability
to trace evidences of 'broader forms of impact'. Our first results are not
promising and question current approaches being made in the field of
altmetrics.</p>

research funding bodies, scientific entities and government agencies. In this
study, we investigate whether text features extracted from projects title and
abstracts are able to identify productive grants. Our analysis was conducted in
three distinct areas, namely Medicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Medicine.
Topical and complexity text features were used to identify predictors of
productivity. The results indicate that there is a statistically significant
relationship between text features and grants productivity, however such a
dependence is weak. A feature relevance analysis revealed that the abstract
text length and metrics derived from lexical diversity are among the most
discriminative features. We also found that the prediction accuracy has a
dependence on the considered project language and that topical features are
more discriminative than text complexity measurements. Our findings suggest
that text features should be used in combination with other features to assist
the identification of relevant research ideas.</p>

vision, such as object tracking and recognition, security, military, and
biomedical image analysis. This review presents the application of
convolutional neural networks in one of the fields of dentistry - orthodontics.
Advances in medical imaging technologies and methods allow CNNs to be used in
orthodontics to shorten the planning time of orthodontic treatment, including
an automatic search of landmarks on cephalometric X-ray images, tooth
segmentation on Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images or digital models,
and classification of defects on X-Ray panoramic images. In this work, we
describe the current methods, the architectures of deep convolutional neural
networks used, and their implementations, together with a comparison of the
results achieved by them. The promising results and visualizations of the
described studies show that the use of methods based on convolutional neural
networks allows for the improvement of computer-based orthodontic treatment
planning, both by reducing the examination time and, in many cases, by
performing the analysis much more accurately than a manual orthodontist does.</p>

paramount importance to improve evaluation processes. In this context, we
analyzed whether bibliometric features are able to predict the success of
research grants. We extracted features aiming at characterizing the academic
history of Brazilian researchers, including research topics, affiliations,
number of publications and visibility. The extracted features were then used to
predict grants productivity via machine learning in three major research areas,
namely Medicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Medicine. We found that research
subject and publication history play a role in predicting productivity. In
addition, institution-based features turned out to be relevant when combined
with other features. While the best results outperformed text-based attributes,
the evaluated features were not highly discriminative. Our findings indicate
that predicting grants success, at least with the considered set of
bibliometric features, is not a trivial task.</p>
