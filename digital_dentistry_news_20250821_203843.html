        <p id="ai1" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Title: Importance of Automated Patient Eligibility Verification in Healthcare Practices

The article discusses the significance of automating patient eligibility verification, a process that checks a patient's insurance coverage and benefits before treatment, minimizing claim denials and ensuring smooth cash flow.

Automation simplifies financial discussions with patients, reducing potential complications arising from misunderstandings about insurance coverage. It also addresses various business concerns:

1. Reduced Insurance Issues: Automated checks minimize disputes between practices and insurance providers by verifying coverage details before treatment.
2. Accurate Billing: Deductibles, co-pays, maximum benefits, and coverage variations are confirmed, ensuring correct billing to insurance companies.
3. Improved Patient Experience: Clarity about treatment options covered by insurance reduces confusion for patients and provides a clear picture of out-of-pocket expenses.
4. Streamlined Billing Process: Knowledge of patient eligibility leads to smoother billing, quicker claim submission, and prompt payment collection.
5. Clear Limitations: Understanding insurance coverage helps manage patient expectations and avoid disputes about treatment payments.
6. Regulatory Compliance: Verifying patient eligibility ensures adherence to healthcare regulations and billing guidelines.

The article concludes by encouraging healthcare practices to adopt automated patient eligibility verification systems for a more efficient, effective, and compliant patient billing experience.</p>

Despite dental implants being initially perceived as less invasive and more durable, they have proven to be problematic in many cases due to 40 years of usage.

Dr. Ruiz will present this course, covering indications, principles for success, preparatory designs for various situations on both anterior and posterior teeth, techniques for temporizing, and predictable bonded cementation using different restorative materials like zirconia. The learning objectives include understanding the benefits and applications of bonded bridges in modern dentistry.</p>

        <p id="ai8" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In light of the resumption of schooling in New York, CDPHP and Delta Dental Insurance Company are stressing the importance of oral health for students. Regular dental checkups are crucial for children's confidence, health, and academic success. To raise awareness about preventive dental care, CDPHP, along with Delta Dental Insurance Company and the All Smiles Welcome campaign, is launching its Back-Tooth-School (BTS) initiative. This statewide promotion aims to educate CDPHP members about their no-cost dental benefits through Delta Dental and connect them with dentists for lifelong oral health.

Unattended dental issues can affect a child's ability to eat, sleep, and speak properly, which can impact their classroom performance. Tooth decay is the most prevalent chronic disease among U.S. children, affecting over half of children aged 6-8 and 12-19. However, cavities are preventable with regular dental checkups and preventive services like fluoride treatments and molar sealants, which are covered at no extra cost for children when they visit an in-network Delta Dental provider through CDPHP.

To promote oral health among local families, the All Smiles Welcome team will be participating in two events: the New Jerusalem Community Block Party in Albany, NY, on August 23, and the Back-to-School Celebration at Watervliet High School, Watervliet, NY, on September 6. These events offer free health screenings and connect families with wellness resources, including information about CDPHP dental benefits.

CDPHP members can find in-network Delta Dental dentists at AllSmilesWelcome.com or by calling Delta Dental Customer Service at 1-800-542-9782. The All Smiles Welcome campaign, developed by Delta Dental Insurance Company, encourages CDPHP members to utilize their dental benefits for regular and routine dental services, preventive care, and restorative treatments.</p>
