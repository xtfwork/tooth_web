        <p id="ai1" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Glidewell has introduced its latest product, GlidePRO, a stackable surgical guide system designed for simplifying full-arch implant procedures. This next-generation tool offers restorative-driven planning, personalized support, and same-day provisionalization, all within a streamlined digital workflow.

GlidePRO's top-down treatment approach begins with the final restoration in mind, ensuring prosthetic success and surgical precision. It is supported by a dedicated team of experts throughout the process. The system offers efficiency through its same-day design service, enabling immediate fixed provisional restoration post-surgery for patients.

The same-day design service caters to flexibility in workflow, accommodating various digital impression capture methods, such as photogrammetry and OPTISPLINT. This adaptability allows clinicians to choose their preferred scanning method without compromising accuracy or predictability.

Patients experience less invasive procedures due to pre-planned guided steps that reduce surgical time and tissue trauma, leading to faster healing and increased comfort. The immediate provision of fixed teeth also provides psychological, functional, and aesthetic benefits.

Dr. Bushra Imam, BDS, director of education & training at Glidewell, emphasized the precision and predictability of the stackable guides in full-arch implant placement. Dr. Taylor Manalili, DDS, director of clinical prosthodontics at Glidewell, highlighted that GlidePRO offers a fully integrated workflow from treatment planning to final restorative design.

        <p id="abs2" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In this interview with Dentistry Today, HuFriedyGroup experts explain why dental practices need to ensure they are properly maintaining their DUWLs.

        <p id="ai2" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In this interview with Dentistry Today, HuFriedyGroup experts discuss the importance of maintaining dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) due to their potential for bacterial growth. While dental practices understand the need for regular cleaning and disinfection, they may not be aware of the best options available or encounter challenges in implementing optimal practices.

HuFriedyGroup emphasizes the significance of consistent infection control practices, particularly with regard to DUWLs, to protect patients and staff from harmful bacteria during treatment. They introduce their product, the DentaPure Independent Water Bottle Cartridge DentaPure DP365B, which ensures water compliance with potable water standards and reduces the possibility of human error due to fewer protocol requirements.

Water treatment is crucial for maintaining clean DUWLs, as bacteria from sources like the patient’s mouth or municipal water supply can form biofilms that are difficult to remove if not regularly treated with germicidal waterline maintenance products. The DentaPure Cartridge contains iodinated resin beads and releases 2 to 6ppm of elemental iodine into the water passing through it, controlling bacteria in the water.

The interview highlights the importance of staying informed about the best methods for ensuring clean dental water, looking to state dental boards, CDC, ADA, and ADS for guidance. It also addresses concerns related to patients with iodine allergies, stating that elemental iodine does not cause sensitivity reactions.

Overall, the article stresses the importance of consistent DUWL maintenance practices in protecting both patients and staff from potential exposure to contaminated water during dental procedures. It encourages dental offices to establish protocols and stay updated on the latest developments in the field.</p>

The focus has shifted from strictly clinical and sterile environments towards creating spaces that are modern, intentional, and aligned with patients' desires.

Design plays a crucial role in establishing clinical credibility. Patients are drawn to spaces that offer a balance of warmth and healthcare expertise. Trends to help build trust, reinforce expertise, and set the stage for long-term success include:

1. Showcasing digital labs
2. Prioritizing privacy for comfort
3. Using elevated neutrals in design
4. Making inclusive design non-negotiable
5. Featuring sterilization areas
6. Designing with flexibility and future needs in mind
7. Fine-tuning spaces for calmness and professionalism
8. Optimizing storage for cleanliness and organization
9. Rethinking small reception areas to maximize visual interest

Rhode emphasizes that the best practice designs combine comfort and credibility intentionally, allowing patients to feel the expertise of the dental team and fostering trust.

        <p id="ai4" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Dr. Louis Kaufman, a dental consultant and lecturer, shares his experience with a phone scam in July 2025. The caller claimed to be a Highland Park police officer, providing personal details about him, including his date of birth, business address, and federal check information. They claimed he had been overpaid through the ERC program, missed a court hearing, and a warrant was issued for his arrest.

The fraudster directed him to withdraw cash using Bitcoin and pay a fine, all while staying on the phone. Despite his suspicions, the scammer's convincing answers and specific details kept Kaufman in doubt. It wasn't until he accessed another phone and called the Lake County Sheriff's Department that he realized the call was fraudulent.

Kaufman and his wife reported the incident to the police, who informed them that they were targeted due to their clean criminal record, successful profession, and recent receipt of PPP and ERC funds. The scammers use "ghosting" phone lines, official language, and public records to build credible stories.

The experience left Kaufman feeling a complex mix of emotions, including humiliation, anger, relief, and unease. He decided to share his story to prevent others from falling victim to similar scams. His advice is to never provide personal information over the phone or wire money to unknown sources. If contacted by someone claiming to be law enforcement, hang up and report the incident to local police immediately.</p>

        <p id="ai8" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Dr. Robert G. Hale, a prominent oral and maxillofacial surgeon, unveiled the first FDA-approved device for treating patients ineligible for traditional dental implants - the KLS Martin Preprosthetic. This device offers an alternative to invasive procedures like extensive grafting or zygomatic implants, by providing a predictable and durable solution for individuals with edentulous ridge deformities or failed implant sites. The minimally invasive procedure can be performed in approximately 90 minutes under procedural sedation, restoring function, comfort, and quality of life to those who were previously unable to receive implants.

        <p id="ai15" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article discusses CLEARFIL MAJESTY ES Flow Universal, a versatile flowable composite material designed for both anterior and posterior applications. Its unique light diffusion technology and enamel-like translucency coupled with dentine-like chroma ensure seamless integration with the surrounding tooth structure. The material comes in two shades, Universal and Universal Dark, offering effortless shade selection.

Moreover, this flowable composite exhibits exceptional strength, comparable to many paste-type composites, with a flexural strength of 152 MPa and a compressive strength of 374 MPa. The material is available in two viscosities: Low and Super Low (only Super Low being available in the US).

CLEARFIL MAJESTY ES Flow Universal can be used for stress-bearing areas and indications include direct restorations, cavity classes, cervical lesions, tooth wear and erosion, placement of a cavity base or liner, correction of tooth position and shape, intra-oral repair of fractured restorations, and cementation of ceramic and composite inlays, onlays, and veneers less than 2 mm thick. In summary, the material's exceptional properties make it an ideal choice for a wide range of dental applications.</p>

        <p id="ai16" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Researchers at Purdue University have developed a new hydrogel treatment for xerostomia, a condition characterized by dry mouth that can exacerbate swallowing disorders. Current pharmacological treatments offer temporary relief but may cause side effects. This new hydrogel, created by combining artificial saliva with a biocompatible polymer, is small enough to be placed on the inner cheek or under the tongue and can hold four times its volume in artificial saliva, releasing it slowly over four hours at body temperature. The hydrogel has been shown to be reusable up to five times, biocompatible, and has a high storage capacity. Future research aims to enhance durability, optimize release capacity, and create a fully dissolvable version for clinical application. The ultimate goal is to provide an affordable and effective treatment option for those with xerostomia.</p>
