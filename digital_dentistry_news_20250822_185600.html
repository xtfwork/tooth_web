Manning, MBA Are you one of the many dentists who assumes that your patients know the value of comprehensive dentistry? They do not. This is the main reason patients must “think about” their treatment plans before they give a resounding “Yes!” […]

        <p id="ai2" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In "4 Steps You Can Start Now To Increase Case Acceptance," Scott J. Manning suggests a four-step approach for dental practices to increase case acceptance, profitability, and build long-term relationships with patients.

The first step is setting the stage by using pre-exam materials such as videos, welcome packets, and documentation that communicate the comprehensive approach of whole-health dentistry. This helps change a patient's mindset from a simple checkup to a more significant conversation about overall health and well-being.

The second step involves expanding vision and self-diagnosis during the clinical experience by asking patients to rate their oral health on a scale, and then discussing how treatment can help them achieve a higher ranking. This approach makes patients more invested in their outcomes.

Thirdly, present treatment as a whole solution rather than fragmented procedures. Offer one comprehensive treatment plan without breaking it down into separate segments or offering price breakdowns by visit. Show patients the total solution and end result instead of a list of procedures.

Finally, create lifelong patients post-visit by scheduling follow-up appointments for untreated issues, maintaining a structured follow-up process, appreciating and surprising patients with small touches, and turning happy patients into advocates for the practice through referrals, reviews, and testimonials.

By mastering these steps, dental practices can shift from transactional to relationship-based models that deliver sustainable success for both practitioners and patients. To learn more about Scott J. Manning's approach, visit https://dentalsuccesstoday.com/.</p>

The looming tariffs could increase operating costs for both individual dental offices and Dental Service Organizations (DSOs), as well as raise the cost of dental supplies and equipment. This could lead to increased prices for consumers, exacerbating inflation. Despite assurances from the Trump administration that tariff-induced costs will affect foreign exporters rather than American consumers, consumer prices for services have been increasing since July. Additionally, public disapproval of Trump's tariff policies is high, with 61% of Americans expressing their dissatisfaction according to a recent Pew Research Center poll. The potential fallout and trickle-down effects from the tariffs may deter consumers from seeking dental services, further straining the industry.</p>

NADG has recently implemented Overjet’s IRIS Smart Imaging software across its 240 practice locations, signifying the integration of AI into dentistry.

Dr. Wardah Inam of Overjet highlights that AI is no longer just a tool but a product enhancing human work. The focus has shifted from dental AI being in dentistry to it being an AI native imaging software. Inam emphasizes the importance of being intentional with AI use, ensuring it improves patient diagnosis and communication.

Paul Reda, NADG's CEO, sees AI as a tool to improve the patient experience, supporting the team without replacing human interaction. Reda underlines that AI should make billing more efficient, enhancing the overall patient experience.

In terms of future advancements, Paul Reda hopes to see 3D imaging and AI dictation for notes from Overjet, along with an educational tool to aid doctors in explaining treatments to patients. Wardah Inam agrees and expresses excitement about potential automation on the revenue cycle management side, aiming to reduce costs associated with collecting payments and direct more funds towards patient care and growth.</p>

        <p id="ai14" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The University of British Columbia has developed a secure app, ToothPortal, that connects senior patients in long-term care with dentistry students for oral health care. Caregivers upload oral health concerns via the app, which includes patient details, medical history, and photos, all within a secure digital environment. This information is then triaged by dental teams to determine urgency and schedule appointments. Third-year dental students use the app to screen patients, while fourth-year students deliver care in an educational experience that spans from digital triage to hands-on treatment. The app has reduced unnecessary appointments through digital consultations and treatment planning. As the global teledentistry market is expected to grow significantly by 2030, this solution addresses a growing need, especially among seniors who often have poor oral health and limited access to dental services.</p>
