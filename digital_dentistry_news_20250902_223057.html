        <p id="ai1" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Today witnessed significant consolidation movements in the dental 3D printing industry with Pac-Dent, Inc.'s acquisition of Ackuretta Technologies. This move follows SprintRay's recent acquisition of EnvisionTEC's dental portfolio, signaling an accelerating trend towards industry consolidation that will redefine digital dentistry. Pac-Dent aims to create an "open-system vision" by integrating their renowned Rodin resin materials with Ackuretta's SOL printer platform and ALPHA AI CAM software, offering a comprehensive end-to-end solution for both chairside and laboratory applications.

Unlike other industry acquisitions that have focused on saving uncertain customers, Pac-Dent is concentrating on expansion. They intend to maintain an open ecosystem by validating workflows across multiple hardware platforms, giving practitioners flexibility in their equipment decisions. The acquisition also brings together Ackuretta's international team, expanding Pac-Dent's global reach and support capabilities, and positions the combined entity for next-generation workflow intelligence and automation through AI-powered solutions.

        </span>
        <p id="ai2" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">SprintRay has announced a significant acquisition of EnvisionTEC's assets, marking one of the most impactful deals in dental 3D printing history. This move is being hailed as a potential industry game-changer, offering respite to stranded EnvisionTEC customers and promising continuity of service. SprintRay aims to maintain existing EnvisionTEC products while integrating their own innovations, particularly focusing on lab market efficiency and automation.

In the aftermath of Desktop Health's mismanagement, which left thousands of customers high and dry, SprintRay's acquisition is being seen as a rescue mission that could reshape the entire industry. The deal includes exclusive rights to EnvisionTEC's products, patents, IP, trademarks, and customer lists, without assuming their liabilities. While the exact financial details are undisclosed, it's noted that EnvisionTEC was previously sold for $300 million.

For stranded EnvisionTEC customers, SprintRay has pledged continuity of service, ensuring resin, tank, and software support. They also plan to make their resins compatible with EnvisionTEC printers, and vice versa, promoting a controlled openness in the market.

SprintRay's entry into the dental lab market with this acquisition signals their intention to compete aggressively. They aim to bring cloud connectivity, focus on automation and efficiency, leverage EnvisionTEC's engineering-focused approach, and maintain separate brands for different market segments. The move is being seen as a strategic consolidation that could lead to better support, more innovation, and a stronger industry overall, rather than the typical acquisitions that primarily benefit shareholders at the expense of users.

Time will tell if SprintRay can successfully manage two distinct brands serving different markets and repair EnvisionTEC's damaged reputation. However, given their track record and Amir Mansouri's confidence in their ability to compound multiple things done right over ten years, many are cautiously optimistic about the future of dental 3D printing.</p>

        <p id="ai5" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article discusses the benefits and cost comparison between traditional dentures and digital dentures created using computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology. Digital dentures are more precise, efficient, and customizable due to the use of intraoral scanners, specialized software, and 3D printing or milling.

In terms of cost, digital dentures can range from $800-1,500 (economy), $1,500-3,000 (mid-range), to $3,000-5,000+ (premium) per arch in the United States. While more expensive initially, digital dentures offer better long-term value due to fewer appointments, enhanced customization, easy replacements, and cost savings from reduced labor costs, material costs, and time efficiency.

For dental professionals considering implementing digital denture workflows, the initial investment includes intraoral scanners, wash and nanocure stations, and materials. Although there's an upfront investment, digital workflows are more cost-effective over time with faster return on investment (ROI) timelines. The article suggests a hybrid approach, full digital integration, or focusing on high-value cases as strategies for implementing 3D dentures into dental practices.

In summary, the shift towards digital dentures represents a transformation in dental care delivery, offering improved comfort, aesthetics, convenience, efficiency, predictability, and profitability for both patients and clinicians. The SprintRay Pro2, an advanced 3D printer for dental applications, is presented as a solution that can help dental practices capitalize on the benefits of digital dentures while maximizing practice efficiency and patient satisfaction.</p>

        <p id="ai18" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In a large-scale study, researchers from Shiga University of Medical Science found that regular dental maintenance preserves more teeth than treatment-only care, regardless of age or diabetes status. The study, published in Diabetology International, analyzed a Japanese health database covering 705,542 adults aged 20–74. The findings indicate that people with well-managed diabetes (HbA1c under 7%) keep about as many natural teeth as those without diabetes. However, poor glycemic control is linked to faster tooth loss. Only 46% of participants saw a dentist in the past year, and preventive care was shown to be more effective at preserving teeth than treatment-only visits. The authors emphasize the importance of tighter medical–dental collaboration, urging individuals to maintain HbA1c targets and prioritize preventive dental visits to protect oral health. Despite not establishing causality, the study's strength lies in its extensive data scale and detail.</p>

        <p id="ai19" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing dentistry in Australia, according to a new national review. AI is impacting clinical decision-making, treatment planning, and diagnostic accuracy, with machine learning systems demonstrating improved early detection and precision compared to traditional methods. Predictive models are also being developed to anticipate disease progression, supporting personalized care for patients.

In education, AI is expanding training opportunities, particularly for students in rural areas through virtual learning environments and AI-assisted feedback. Wearable devices and teledentistry powered by AI aim to address service delivery gaps in remote regions. AI-powered mobile apps are gaining global popularity.

However, the integration of AI raises ethical and regulatory issues such as bias in algorithms, patient privacy concerns, potential machine errors, and over-reliance on automated outputs. The review emphasizes that practitioners must remain accountable for their decisions, regardless of the technology used, and the profession needs to strengthen its frameworks for regulation, training, and collaboration to harness AI's benefits while safeguarding trust.

The study, titled "Artificial intelligence in Australian dental and general healthcare: A scoping review," was published in the Australian Dental Journal on August 10, 2025. It highlights the need for responsible uptake of AI to reduce disparities, ease workforce pressures, and modernize oral health approaches, while avoiding risks to equity, safety, and professional autonomy.</p>

        <p id="ai20" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The dental industry is facing tough market conditions due to macroeconomic pressures, as highlighted by financial reports from major companies like Straumann Group, Dentsply Sirona, Align Technology, and Envista Holdings. These companies are adapting by trimming operations, investing in local supply chains, focusing on growth markets, and implementing future-proofing measures.

Straumann Group, for example, saw a 5.9% decrease in North American sales but showed a 2.7% increase on an organic basis. The company's strong performance was driven by implantology, with increased adoption of digital workflows. In contrast, Dentsply Sirona reported a 4.9% year-on-year decline in net sales due to the impacts from tariffs and lower volumes in certain segments.

Align Technology experienced a 1.6% drop in total revenue, attributed to contractions in sales of imaging systems and aligner revenues. However, Envista Holdings reported growth in all major business segments, including dental implant specialist Nobel Biocare in North America. The company increased its full-year guidance for core sales growth to within a range of 3%–4%.
