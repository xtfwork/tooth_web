        <p id="ai1" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article announces a free CE webinar scheduled for August 21 at 8 PM (Eastern Time). The focus of the webinar is on the advancements in bonded bridges as an alternative to dental implants. Traditionally, implants have been preferred due to their minimal invasiveness and durability. However, after four decades of using dental implants, it has become evident that they are not always less invasive or problem-free.

Dr. Ruiz will lead the course, discussing the indications for bonded bridges, principles for success, appropriate prep designs for various situations on both anterior and posterior teeth, and step-by-step techniques for temporizing and predictable bonded cementation of different restorative materials, including zirconia. The learning objectives aim to equip clinicians with the knowledge necessary to apply these modern bonded bridge techniques effectively.</p>

The study emphasizes the correlation between oral and mental health, as well as the influence of social determinants on dental health. Key findings include:

1. Black adults are 67% more likely than white adults to experience tooth loss.
2. Individuals with depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues have a higher chance of developing dental diseases.
3. Integrating oral care into behavioral health settings could speed up recovery from mental health and substance use disorders.
4. Fifty-six percent of survey participants experienced improved at-home oral health after an education intervention, and 36% scheduled dental appointments as a result.
5. Forty percent of rural residents have not seen a dentist in over a year, contrasting with 35% of urban residents and 30% of suburban residents.
6. Food insecurity is associated with a 30% lower likelihood of good oral health.
7. Cost is the primary barrier for 50% of survey respondents from pursuing dental treatment, followed by cost of insurance (30%) and other reasons (20%).

The report also suggests that integrating oral care into behavioral health settings could potentially expedite recovery from mental health or substance use disorders.</p>

        <p id="ai8" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article discusses the growing trend of dental graduates joining Dental Service Organizations (DSOs) due to economic benefits and career growth opportunities. Dr. Barry Lyon, dental director for Main Street Children’s Dentistry and Orthodontics and chief clinical auditor for Dental Care Alliance, shares insights on this migration. He notes that as dental students begin their job searches nine to twelve months before graduation, they often consider opening a practice, joining an existing private practice, or working for a DSO, with the latter becoming increasingly popular due to factors like student debt and economic uncertainty. Data from the American Dental Association shows a significant decrease in dentists owning practices early in their careers since 2010, while approximately 34% of dental students now aim to join a DSO-affiliated practice upon graduation. The high retention rates at some DSOs (up to 98%) and the opportunity for doctors to acquire equity positions within these organizations are key factors contributing to this trend.</p>

        <p id="ai13" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">According to Sundeep Rawal, DMD, senior vice president of implant support services for Aspen Dental, artificial intelligence (AI) is set to revolutionize dental care over the next five years. AI will touch every aspect of dentistry, from patient-facing interactions to business operations. The dental office of tomorrow will see a complete transformation in care delivery models, with diagnosis, treatment plans, and execution becoming more predictable, standardized, and data-driven. Patients will experience faster, more instantaneous care due to AI's rapid decision-making capabilities. This shift towards on-demand healthcare is driven by the consumer-centric model of dental care in the U.S., which allows for quicker adaptations compared to traditional healthcare systems. In five years, Rawal predicts that 80-85% of dental care will be provided the same day with data-driven decision-making and predictable outcomes.</p>

        <p id="ai14" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">A study published in Antibiotics has found that a natural compound called 3,3′-Diindolylmethane (DIM), found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and kale, can significantly reduce the formation of oral microbial biofilms responsible for cavities. This compound targets Streptococcus mutans, the main bacterium behind tooth decay, reducing its biofilm formation by 92%. The study suggests that DIM could be added to toothpastes and mouthwashes to enhance dental hygiene due to its low toxicity. This potential application could help in preventing cavities by disrupting S. mutans biofilms.</p>

        <p id="ai16" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The British Dental Journal has published a study highlighting the high levels of stress and burnout among dental professionals in the UK, primarily attributed to systemic issues within the National Health Service (NHS) dentistry. The study, titled "Me, we, they: Identifying the key stressors affecting the dental team", gathered responses from over 1,500 dental professionals.

The main stress factors identified were workload, NHS system pressures, regulatory compliance and litigation, financial pressures, leadership and management, and self-worth. An intolerable workload was the most common complaint, worsened by recruitment and retention difficulties. The NHS contractual framework, particularly England's units of dental activity system, was widely criticized for creating unachievable targets and constant pressure.

Regulation and litigation fears were also prominent, with dentists expressing concerns about the atmosphere from regulatory bodies and the fear of disciplinaries and litigation. Financial strain was keenly felt, with dental care professionals highlighting poor wages and practice owners struggling with stagnant NHS funding and rising costs. Poor leadership quality, lack of support, and feelings of low self-worth were also common among respondents.

The study concludes that current reactive approaches are insufficient and that macro-level change is essential to enable dental teams to develop, flourish, and feel valued. Without such changes, the profession faces worsening burnout, attrition, and risks to patient safety. The findings underscore the urgent need for reform within NHS dentistry to address these systemic issues and improve the mental health and well-being of dental professionals.</p>
