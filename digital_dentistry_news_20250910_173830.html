        </span>
        <p id="ai4" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In a discussion by co-founders of vVARDIS, Drs. Haley and Goly Abivardi, they highlight the importance of early detection of dental caries due to its global prevalence and preventable nature. They emphasize that early intervention can eliminate traditional drilling and filling, preserving natural tooth structure, and aligning with minimally invasive dentistry. However, non-cavitated enamel lesions can be difficult to detect with the naked eye or standard radiographic interpretation.

AI is transforming early caries detection by identifying patterns in dental x-rays that may indicate early carious changes, improving accuracy and reproducibility compared to human interpretation. AI also reduces inter-clinician variability. The science behind caries treatment has evolved from a binary health/disease view to recognizing it as a spectrum, with an emphasis on biological management rather than surgical repair.

Minimally invasive treatment of early caries involves noninvasive therapies like dietary counseling and topical enamel repair agents, while newer techniques use biomimetic materials to arrest lesion progression. Patients prefer minimally invasive care, and innovative solutions like Curodont (vVARDIS) offer noninvasive treatment for early caries using guided enamel repair.

The future of early caries management lies in personalized, data-driven preventive care, aiming to reduce the prevalence of restorative dentistry over time and focus on long-term oral wellness. Drs. Haley and Goly Abivardi are co-CEOs and co-founders of vVARDIS, a Swiss healthcare company offering proprietary, biomimetic technology for early caries treatment under the Curodont brand.</p>

        <p id="ai13" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The Health and Human Services (HHS) Department's Make America Healthy Again Commission has released a strategy focusing on children's health, which includes 120 initiatives to align incentives, increase public awareness, and strengthen private-sector collaboration. The commission identified fluoride as a substance that may impact children's health, citing research linking fluoride exposure to reduced IQ levels in children.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expected to review the potential risks associated with drinking fluoridated water, which will guide recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to take action against unapproved products marketed as supplements.

These actions follow the HHS Department's May announcement that the FDA would begin removing ingestible fluoride prescription drug products for children due to their unapproval by the FDA and evidence of ingested fluoride altering the gut microbiome. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has previously advocated for scaling back fluoride in drinking water.</p>

According to Denver 7's report on September 8, Ssun Health, established in 2018 and growing to support over ten practices across multiple states, faced financial troubles starting more than a year later. Employees and vendors alleged non-payment of wages and unfulfilled lease agreements. A court receiver was appointed to manage operations after the DSO defaulted on loans exceeding $8 million.

Beyond personal bankruptcy, Mr. Nuss is also dealing with numerous other legal challenges and accusations of mismanagement and questionable expenditures. The situation underscores the potential risks and consequences associated with the rapid expansion and management of a DSO in the healthcare sector.</p>
