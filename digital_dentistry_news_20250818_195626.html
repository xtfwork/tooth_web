        <p id="ai1" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article announces a free CE webinar scheduled for August 21 at 8 PM (Eastern Time). The webinar focuses on the use of bonded bridges in dentistry, which is presented as a viable alternative to dental implants for missing teeth. Despite the common belief that implants are minimally invasive and problem-free, recent advancements in adhesives, porcelains, and manufacturing techniques have made bonded bridges more attractive.

In the webinar, Dr. Ruiz will discuss the indications and principles for success of bonded bridges, providing prep designs suitable for various circumstances on both anterior and posterior teeth. The course will also cover step-by-step techniques for temporizing and predictable bonded cementation using different restorative materials, including zirconia.

The learning objectives for the webinar are to equip clinicians with knowledge about when to use bonded bridges, how to prepare teeth for these bridges in various situations, and techniques for bonding different materials used in dentistry.</p>

        <p id="abs10" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Economic uncertainties and performance shortcomings have led some large-scale DSOs to fail at recapitalizing their capital structures, according to one dental industry consultant.

        <p id="ai10" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Stan Kinder, founder and president of Everything DSO, expressed his excitement about advancements in dental technology, particularly AI, improving both administrative and clinical efficiency. He also discussed concerns regarding the evolution of the DSO market. Some large-scale DSOs have experienced difficulties recapitalizing their capital structures due to underperformance and industry-wide economic uncertainties such as tariffs, potential recessions, and labor shortages, particularly in hygiene departments. Kinder attributes these failed recapitalization efforts to operational inefficiencies, the slowdown of recapitalizations across private equity, increased debt costs, and broader economic anxieties.</p>

        <p id="ai11" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In a growing competitive landscape among Dental Service Organizations (DSOs), the focus is shifting towards how companies support their dental providers and prioritize patient care. At Becker's "Dental + DSO Virtual Event," four executives discussed strategies for newer DSOs to stand out from larger, established organizations.

Haim Haviv, Founder and CEO of Hudson Dental, emphasized the importance of offering autonomy, equity, understanding demographics, and adapting to technology for new groups in a market. Jeremy Jonckheere, Vice President of Strategic Payer Partnerships at PDS Health, highlighted the need for a scalable platform, a strong focus on patient and clinician experience, and a health-oriented culture for long-term growth.

Zach Cherry, Vice President of Operations at Heartland Dental, stressed the importance of individualized support, providing resources for personal and professional growth, and focusing on leadership opportunities for both doctors and team members. Lastly, Jeffrey DeBellis, COO at MAX Surgical Specialty Management, underlined the significance of surgeon-led organizations to maintain a patient-focused approach by involving caregivers in decision making.

Ultimately, all executives agreed on the importance of putting people first – both patients and staff – for long-term success in the DSO industry.</p>

This shift in the dental industry is under scrutiny as it may impact the quality of care, autonomy, and small-practice sustainability.</p>

        <p id="ai17" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article discusses a comprehensive protocol for placing aligner attachments using Tetric EvoCeram Aligner composite, focusing on accuracy, consistency, and control to deliver optimal treatment outcomes. The step-by-step process includes isolation, etching and bonding, loading the template with composite, seating and curing, checking for flash, polishing, and protecting the attachments.

Common causes of attachment debonding, such as lack of proper isolation, inconsistent adhesive systems, residual composite, and radiolucency, are addressed, along with solutions to prevent such occurrences. The article emphasizes the importance of using a streamlined restorative system like Ivoclar's, including OptraGate 2 retractor, Adhese Universal, Bluephase PowerCure, OptraSculpt and OptraGloss systems, for strong retention, esthetics, and efficiency.

The fluorescent property of Tetric EvoCeram Aligner composite is highlighted as a key benefit during attachment placement and removal, allowing for easy detection of flash and leftover composite. The protocol not only prevents failures but also streamlines the re-bonding process should an attachment come off. The article concludes that a repeatable system like this one is essential for handling increasingly complex clear aligner cases.</p>
