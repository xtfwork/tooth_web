For decades, dental amalgam was the go-to solution for posterior restorations as they were strong, and simple. But as materials science evolves and patient expectations grow, it’s time to consider smart, safe, and more esthetic alternatives. GC brings to you solutions designed to meet the demands of modern clinical dentistry without the compromises and potential […]

        <p id="ai1" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article discusses the evolution of dental restoratives, moving away from traditional amalgam towards more advanced, esthetic, and safe alternatives offered by GC. Two key products are highlighted: EQUIA Forte® HT and G-ænial™ A’CHORD.

EQUIA Forte® HT is a glass hybrid restorative that addresses challenges such as compromised oral environments and limited patient cooperation. It offers fast, single-step placement, improved handling, increased translucency, high fluoride release, and durability. This makes it particularly advantageous for situations where long-term protection against recurrent decay is essential, especially in patients with reduced saliva production (xerostomia).

G-ænial™ A’CHORD is a versatile, high-performance composite that simplifies restorative procedures across all classes of cavities. It features a streamlined shade system, easy handling, excellent wear resistance, and gloss retention, making it suitable for both anterior and posterior restorations. It offers a clinically efficient and esthetic alternative to traditional amalgam fillings.

The article also introduces the "sandwich technique" as an alternative to amalgam in difficult isolation cases such as deep Class II or subgingival restorations. The technique uses a base layer of moisture-tolerant, resin-reinforced glass ionomers and is overlaid with esthetic composites like G-ænial™ A’CHORD or G-ænial™ Universal Injectable. This approach offers a more conservative and biologically sound method compared to amalgam, without compromising clinical performance.

The article concludes that moving away from amalgam represents a shift towards materials that are biocompatible, clinically efficient, and esthetically pleasing, aligning with the future of modern dentistry.

        <p id="ai2" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article announces a free CE webinar scheduled for August 21st at 8 PM (Eastern Time). The topic is the use of bonded bridges in modern dentistry, which is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to dental implants. After four decades of using dental implants, it has been recognized that they are not always less invasive or problem-free as initially thought.

The webinar, led by Dr. Ruiz, will focus on the indications, success principles, and prep designs for bonded bridges in various circumstances on both anterior and posterior teeth. The course will also cover step-by-step techniques for temporizing and predictable cementation of different restorative materials like zirconia.

The learning objectives include understanding when to use bonded bridges, mastering principles for their successful application, designing preparations in various scenarios, and effectively working with different restorative materials such as zirconia.</p>

Gugino served on the board of directors for Great Lakes and was renowned for his forward-thinking approach to dentistry, earning him respect within the profession. He founded Great Lakes in 1965 with lab technician Peter R. Breads and subsequently guided the company as an advisor and mentor.

John Ende, President and CEO of Great Lakes, described Gugino as a "true visionary" who foresaw the future of dentistry and nurtured a global network to help achieve it. Known for his passion for progress in the field, Gugino was concerned that orthodontics wasn't advancing quickly enough, always advocating for improved patient outcomes.

Gugino received his dental degree from the University of Buffalo in 1953 and served in the United States Navy before obtaining his orthodontic degree. He later became an international teacher and lecturer, focusing on integrating advanced orthodontic concepts into practices worldwide. Gugino co-developed the first computerized cephalometrics and visual treatment objective program in orthodontics, and his work led to the creation of the Zerobase Orthodontic Philosophy.

Great Lakes Dental Technologies, an employee-owned company specializing in orthodontic appliances and products, mourns the loss of Gugino's mentorship and guidance. Many of the management principles he developed continue to be used in orthodontic practices today.</p>

He recounts his experience leading fellow students during ADA Lobby Day in Washington D.C., advocating for dentistry issues such as access to care and underserved communities. This encounter reminded him that dentistry extends beyond the clinic into policy-making.

In the clinic, Carter achieved significant milestones including performing a surgical exposure for an impacted maxillary canine, guiding his first denture case, and leading the Give Kids a Smile Day event at LECOM. These experiences reaffirmed his passion for pediatric dentistry and inspired him to apply for a residency in that field.

Recently relocated to Erie, Pennsylvania, Carter has embraced the new environment, gaining valuable clinical experience and expanding his patient base. The community's warm welcome has further invigorated his dedication to serve and learn. Looking forward, Carter is excited for what lies ahead in his final year of dental school and beyond, as he strives to become a compassionate and effective dentist who prioritizes patient care and advocacy.</p>

        <p id="ai8" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In this reflective piece by Branden Franzen, he discusses his transition into the fourth year of dental school at LECOM School of Dental Medicine. Instead of a typical summer break, he and his classmates moved locations: half went to Erie, Pennsylvania, while the other half started in DeFuniak Springs, Florida. The author found saying goodbye to Bradenton, his peers, faculty, and preceptors who had guided him throughout his dental journey, emotionally challenging.

Entering the final year, he noticed a shift in his role as a student, feeling more autonomous and taking on primary provider responsibilities. This newfound sense of autonomy comes with real responsibility and patient outcomes, which has been empowering. The clinic environment is different, but the author finds growth amidst adjustment.

The new setting brought a new patient population, requiring complex treatment plans to manage multiple failing restorations, missing dentition, periodontal disease, and systemic health concerns. Practicing in rural DeFuniak Springs has been both eye-opening and rewarding, as many patients have gone years without dental care. The author's personal goal is to practice in a rural community, impacting communities where care, compassion, and clinical leadership are needed.

        <p id="ai9" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">In an article for Dentistry Today, veteran dentist and practice management consultant Harvey N. Silverman offers advice on growing dental practices by increasing elective cosmetic dentistry services. The series focuses on patient education tools to identify latent demand from patients seeking cosmetic changes without resorting to selling. The author's system, the Silverman Institute of Cosmetic Dentistry’s Practice Growth System, is designed to fit seamlessly into daily routines and help clinicians set up an Action Plan.

Silverman, who has been teaching and developing technologies in cosmetic dentistry for over 2 decades, presents TIMS (Team Impact Multiplier System), a new approach that helps dentists discover which patients want cosmetic changes. The goal is to make it easier for dental professionals to do more elective cosmetic dentistry while reducing stress on their teams and increasing patient satisfaction.

The author emphasizes the importance of understanding unspoken cosmetic dentistry changes patients desire due to anxieties related to cost, discomfort, shots, time, etc., which often keep these desires hidden. However, TIMS is designed to help patients overcome these concerns and unlock latent demand for cosmetic dentistry in dental practices.

The article also includes a questionnaire that dentists can use to identify their team members' interest in cosmetic dentistry as an example of how to find out where the latent demand exists in a practice for cosmetic dentistry that might not be apparent. Future articles will provide more action steps for building a cosmetic dentistry practice, focusing on the receptionist's role and power education techniques.

        <p id="ai10" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Dr. Sarah Mathai, a California-based dentist, recently utilized Trust AI's clinical intelligence system, Isaac, to discuss a complex periodontal case involving Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Isaac's conversational approach helped Mathai navigate the patient's unique challenges and provided valuable recommendations. This interaction underscores the potential of Trust AI as an 'AI-native' practice management system, designed to streamline dental operations and enhance clinical judgment.

The platform, which has garnered significant interest in recent weeks, represents the fastest-growing dental technology platform in history. Its unique investor composition, consisting of dental industry leaders and practicing dentists, reflects the burgeoning recognition of AI's transformative potential in dentistry.

Trust AI aims to address the current complexity faced by dental practices, which often run on multiple software systems that fail to communicate effectively. The platform introduces an 'AI-native' practice management system, enabling natural conversation interactions and handling intricate tasks behind the scenes. This radical approach simplifies data management, streamlines clinical applications, and offers real-time specialist input for practitioners.

The system also addresses frustrating aspects of dental practice, such as insurance verification and claims processing. By connecting to over 3,500 insurance payers and developing AI capable of interpreting coverage details, Trust AI significantly improves the efficiency of these processes.

As dentistry experiences a shift in practitioner attitudes toward technology, driven largely by the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing for Trust AI's emergence seems ideal. The platform's growth trajectory, entirely through word of mouth, underscores its practical benefits and potential to revolutionize dental practice. With a commitment to expert oversight, continuous improvement, and complete patient privacy, Trust AI continues to evolve, aiming to orchestrate entire practice operations in the near future.</p>

Haim Haviv, CEO of Hudson Dental in New York City, discussed this development during Becker's "Dental + DSO Virtual Event". One surprising trend identified by Haviv is the talent shortage, which has led investors to prioritize recruitment over deals, as they assess the landscape before investing. Smaller platforms, once overlooked, are now attracting private equity due to their potential and agility, as compared to larger entities. This indicates a change in strategy where private equity groups are now entering earlier stages of growth for these smaller groups.</p>

        <p id="ai16" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article discusses the varying perspectives of five dentists on consolidation within the dental industry and its impact on dental independence. While some view consolidation as a threat, potentially harming small, independent practices due to reduced economies of scale, increased overhead, and limited decision-making power, others see it as an opportunity for growth, relief from administrative burdens, and financial stability.

Some dentists argue that consolidation has led to lowered incomes and artificial ceilings for new practitioners, turning them into low-level employees, thus damaging the future of the profession. On the contrary, others highlight benefits such as reduced overhead, shared resources, and allowing dentists to focus more on patient care.

The impact of consolidation is subjective, with some appreciating the personal charm and sense of community offered by smaller practices while others find relief in the administrative support provided by larger organizations. Innovation, customized care, and the ability to make decisions best suited for each unique patient may be limited in group or corporate settings.

Overall, the article presents a nuanced view of consolidation within dentistry, suggesting that it can offer both opportunities and threats depending on one's perspective.</p>

        <p id="ai20" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Sun Life Financial Inc. reported a 10% year-over-year increase in earnings, primarily driven by growth in its U.S. group dental business. Improved dental results, boosted by Medicaid repricing and management actions, resulted in a $21 million increase in underlying net income compared to the previous year. However, an impairment charge of $61 million due to early termination of a U.S. group dental contract partially offset these gains.

In the U.S., group dental sales remained robust despite a 6% decline in overall group benefits sales. The dental unit saw higher commercial and Medicaid sales. Sun Life remains committed to strengthening its health and benefits portfolio in North America, especially its dental segment.

The company celebrated a significant milestone with the first anniversary of administering the Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP), which aims to improve oral healthcare access for up to 9 million residents. As of the report, 5.2 million Canadians have been approved under the federal plan. The financial performance of CDCP was not disclosed in the report.</p>

        <p id="ai22" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">A recent article published in the International Journal of Oral Science highlights a consensus document by Chinese clinicians aiming to optimize the use of digital technologies for complete dentures in clinical practice. The document emphasizes the benefits of digital dentures, including precision, reduced treatment time, improved patient comfort, and remote data sharing for patients with mobility issues.

The consensus document outlines various clinical workflows, such as edentulous digital models, facial scanning, occlusal rims, personalized gothic arch tracers, jaw relation recording, additive and subtractive manufacturing processes. It also provides guidance on managing diverse clinical scenarios, including refabricating existing dentures using digital techniques, transitioning patients from removable partial dentures to complete dentures, and evaluating digital restorations for accuracy, fit, stability, patient satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness.

The authors propose a structured framework for clinical indications, procedural steps, and quality control measures to optimize the application of digital dentures. They anticipate future advancements in CAD/CAM software, materials, intra-oral scanning technology, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality will further improve outcomes and reduce adoption barriers for both clinicians and patients.</p>

        <p id="ai24" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">This article discusses the benefits of polished zirconia crowns over surface-glazed versions in restorative dentistry. Zirconia, a popular material for dental crowns due to its strength, biocompatibility, and esthetics, is vulnerable to wear on opposing enamel when glazed with feldspathic materials. This glazing technique can cause accelerated wear on natural teeth over time due to the roughened surface left by worn glaze, increasing risk of sensitivity, caries, and structural weakness. The article emphasizes that polished zirconia crowns offer long-term oral health benefits by preserving enamel and reducing erosion risk compared to surface-glazed versions.</p>
