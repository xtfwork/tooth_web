        <p id="ai4" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">This case report describes the treatment of a patient with a full-arch rehabilitation using an All-on-X approach, guided by virtual planning and design. The patient's aesthetic concern was a "gummy" smile. Virtual planning simplified the process, aiding in eliminating surgical issues during implant placement, especially when extractions and ridge reduction were part of the treatment. Guided surgery allowed for the virtual planning and design of guides for ridge reduction, implant placement, MUA placement/orientation, and orientation of the immediate provisional hybrid prosthesis. The immediate prosthesis was prefabricated based on virtual planning and design, thereby simplifying chairside time for both the patient and the dentist. Utilization of ioConnect for All-on-X procedures enabled highly precise results and improved communication between the dentist and the dental lab, aiding in prosthetic accuracy. The patient expressed satisfaction with the outcome, and a follow-up appointment was scheduled to restore the implant at site No. 19 and convert the maxillary prosthesis to a final prosthesis using the virtual design of the second provisional prosthesis to replicate the design for the final prosthesis.

Dr. Sarah Mathai, a California-based dentist, recently utilized Trust AI's clinical intelligence system, Isaac, to discuss and strategize a complex periodontal case involving Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. The conversational AI recognized the complexity of the case, considering factors like increased bleeding risk and delayed healing. It suggested modified surgical protocols, inquired about the patient's medications, and recommended specific suture techniques effective for EDS patients. The interaction, available 24/7, resembled having a specialist look over Mathai's shoulder.

Trust AI, the fastest-growing dental technology platform in history, announced a $6 million seed round led by dental industry leaders and successful practicing dentists. This unique investor composition signifies the significant impact of artificial intelligence on dental practice. The system takes a revolutionary approach by introducing an "AI-native" practice management system, streamlining data entry and communication between systems.

The platform's clinical applications are particularly noteworthy, as it generates comprehensive narratives explaining findings in clinical terms, suggests treatment sequences based on evidence-based protocols, and assists in crafting patient-friendly explanations when practitioners upload radiographs. This capability has proven valuable for both experienced dentists and younger practitioners facing complex cases with less mentorship than previous generations.

Trust AI's insurance verification and claims processing are another game-changer, connecting to over 3,500 insurance payers and interpreting coverage details into clear, actionable information. The timing of its emergence is significant as large language models have reached a sophistication level capable of handling complex medical reasoning, dental infrastructure has digitized enough for AI integration, and practitioner attitudes toward technology have shifted due to the pandemic.

The network effect contributes to Trust AI's competitive advantage, with a team of dental specialists and AI evaluators refining the system based on real-world dental scenarios without training on individual patient information. As more dentists adopt the platform, its improvements continuously benefit the entire network, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop.

The future of Trust AI extends beyond current capabilities to orchestrating entire practice operations, from scheduling to inventory management to treatment planning. For now, practitioners are discovering immediate practical benefits such as faster diagnoses, simplified insurance processing, and more time with patients. With its potential to make dentistry more human rather than less, it seems that many dentists have already decided the future is worth exploring at www.trustdentistry.ai.</p>

        <p id="ai9" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">VIVOLTA, a medical electrospinning solutions provider, has partnered with Fibrothelium, a specialist in silk protein biomaterials, to manufacture components for Fibrothelium's SimplySilk membrane - an advanced silk membrane used for guided bone regeneration (GBR) in oral surgery. VIVOLTA will be the exclusive contract manufacturer of SimplySilk membrane electrospun components, utilizing its fully automated MediSpin™ technology to produce the membranes at commercial scale while ensuring consistent quality and regulatory compliance.

The resorbable SimplySilk membrane is designed to facilitate bone regrowth in dental implants, periodontal procedures, and cranio-maxillofacial surgery. It features a unique multi-layer design with porous outer layers promoting rapid soft tissue integration and an optional compact silk fibroin film core that slows biodegradation and enhances mechanical stability. Unlike conventional GBR membranes derived from animal collagen, SimplySilk is entirely free of animal tissue, reducing the risk of pathogen transmission and supporting extended degradation profiles.

The global demand for regenerative dental solutions is growing due to rising dental implant procedures and increasing prevalence of periodontal disease. The GBR membrane market is projected to nearly double from $520 million in 2024 to $950 million by 2033, driven by the need for advanced biomaterial membranes that improve clinical outcomes in implantology and oral surgery. Studies indicate that over 50% of dental implant patients require bone grafting or GBR to rebuild lost bone.

SimplySilk membrane is CE-marked and commercially available in Europe, with excellent performance demonstrated in routine clinical applications. Fibrothelium is preparing for FDA submission, targeting U.S. market approval in 2027. VIVOLTA's partnership with Fibrothelium highlights its ability to support innovators from concept through commercialization, leveraging its electrospinning expertise and MediSpin manufacturing platform to scale up SimplySilk membrane production for global distribution.</p>

        <p id="ai21" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">A Winnipeg dental clinic, Greenwoods Dental Centre, has filed a lawsuit against a former patient over allegedly defamatory online reviews following a tooth extraction in June. The reviews, posted on platforms like Google, Facebook, and Yelp, contain false statements aimed at damaging the clinic's reputation. The legal action seeks damages and an injunction to remove the posts and prevent future defamatory content. This is reportedly the third such lawsuit filed by the dental clinic's operator, Dr. Dheeraj Mittal, since 2021. The clinic maintains that while criticism is acceptable, spreading falsehoods is not, constituting defamation with legal consequences. Previously, the clinic had apologized to the patient, but claims the allegations remain untrue and continue to appear online. This story underscores the importance of good communication in resolving patient disputes and highlights the potential legal ramifications of publishing false online reviews.</p>

        <p id="ai22" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Two health groups, IAOMT and DAMS Inc., have petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban mercury-based dental fillings due to health concerns. These fillings, commonly known as silver fillings or dental amalgam, contain around 50% mercury by weight. The groups argue that mercury is a neurotoxin with specific risks for vulnerable populations.

The European Union has already adopted a regulation banning such fillings by 2025 as part of their Zero Pollution Action Plan, expected to prevent about 10 tonnes of mercury release into the environment by 2030. However, dental organizations like the British Dental Association worry that this could strain the U.K.'s dental system due to amalgam's widespread use in permanent fillings under the National Health Service.

While dental associations in Canada and America support the continued use of amalgam as a safe, effective, and durable restorative material for high-risk patients, they also acknowledge environmental concerns. They have implemented regulations to manage mercury waste and ratified international agreements to phase down mercury use, including in dental materials.

The FDA has already banned mercury in various products such as paints and medications, with a recent ban on its use in vaccines set for 2025. The FDA now advises against using mercury fillings in certain high-risk populations like pregnant women, nursing mothers, children under six, people with neurological conditions, kidney impairment, or sensitivity to mercury.</p>

        <p id="ai23" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">This cross-sectional study evaluated the quality and reliability of top 100 orthognathic surgery videos on BiliBili and TikTok using GQS and mDISCERN tools. Videos on TikTok, which attracted a broader audience, scored lower due to shorter durations and limited content coverage. Professionally uploaded videos were of higher quality than patient-generated ones, particularly those explaining medical knowledge or demonstrating surgical techniques. Orthodontist videos were generally superior to orthognathic surgeon videos. Longer videos tended to be more informative and reliable, while shorter videos limited depth and compromised quality. Despite positive correlation between video quality and reliability, neither was significantly associated with user interaction metrics. The study highlights the need for improved online health content regulation, as patients struggle to evaluate credibility. It suggests that medical professionals should produce accurate, accessible, and engaging videos to promote public awareness of orthognathic surgery. The study has strengths in comparing both leading Chinese short-video platforms, but it's limited by focusing on Chinese-language videos and not accounting for content changes over time. Future cross-cultural studies are necessary to promote reliable online medical information worldwide.</p>

        <p id="ai24" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">Professor Stefan Listl from Heidelberg University has been awarded the IADR Distinguished Scientist Award in social science, epidemiology, and health services research for his significant contributions to dentistry. As a professor of translational health economics and head of the oral health working group at the Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Listl is recognized as a leading researcher in health economics, public health, and dental care research. His work focuses on enhancing quality and cost-effectiveness in dental care, particularly through his extensive research funded by governments and organizations like the EU, US National Institutes of Health, and Germany’s Federal Joint Committee (G-BA).

As a member of various WHO committees, Listl has contributed significantly to global reports on oral health. His team's research provides valuable data on the costs of dental care and productivity losses due to dental diseases, amounting to approximately €640 billion annually. This data is included in recent WHO reports and action plans.

Currently, Listl is coordinating several research projects focusing on improving oral healthcare through better patient-dentist collaboration, developing smarter dental care funding models, and investigating how to better coordinate care for diabetes and periodontitis. These projects aim to break the cycle of these diseases exacerbating each other by optimizing early detection and treatment.</p>

        <p id="ai25" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">A 51-year-old patient sought aesthetic improvement for her smile, with key issues being a peg-shaped maxillary right lateral incisor and a missing maxillary left lateral incisor. Two treatment options were considered: implant or bonded prosthesis replacement of the missing tooth, or transforming the maxillary left canine into a lateral incisor and first premolar into a canine. The second option was chosen due to favorable factors such as low smile line, large central incisors, and acceptable midline deviation. Invisalign Go Plus aligner therapy was proposed to create restorative space. The treatment plan was visualized using Invisalign Smile Architect software, allowing for virtual wax-up of planned subsequent restorations and ensuring sufficient space for the missing tooth. The simulation confirmed the aesthetic rehabilitation of the anterior region, making the planned result satisfying. The patient was shown and discussed the treatment plan in detail to ensure understanding.</p>
