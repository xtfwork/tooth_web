        <p id="ai2" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The NSK Ti-Max Z99L is a flagship dental handpiece designed for optimal functionality, comfort, and safety. Its key features include a 100-degree angled head that follows natural oral cavity curves, enhancing molars access during restorative procedures. The handpiece is also lightweight due to its titanium construction, reducing operator fatigue during long procedures. The DURAPOWER CHUCK ensures a strong and consistent grip on the bur, minimizing bur slippage.

The Z99L addresses heat management with an optimized internal design to prevent overheating and Quattro Spray, NSK's four-port cooling system. This innovative handpiece also offers operators greater flexibility through its two-way water function that allows switching between jet and mist irrigation settings. The Z99L provides a quieter environment, reduced vibration, and a comfortable, well-balanced feel in the hand, making it an attractive choice for dentists looking to upgrade their electric handpiece or transition to electrics. Overall, the NSK Ti-Max Z99L is an efficient, reliable, and comfortable solution that elevates dental workflow and experience without changing established techniques.</p>

        <p id="ai3" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article invites readers to register for a free CE webinar on advanced bonded bridge techniques, scheduled for tomorrow at 8 PM Eastern Time. The webinar will be presented by Dr. Ruiz and focuses on the use of bonded bridges in place of dental implants.

Although dental implants have been traditionally considered less invasive and more durable than other treatments for missing teeth, this perception is being challenged due to advancements in adhesives, porcelains, and manufacturing techniques. The next generation of bonded bridges has shown impressive results, making them a viable alternative.

In the webinar, Dr. Ruiz will discuss indications, principles for success, preparation designs for various anterior and posterior teeth scenarios, and step-by-step methods for temporizing and predictable bonded cementation using different restorative materials like zirconia. The learning objectives aim to equip attendees with the necessary knowledge to confidently incorporate these advanced bonded bridge techniques into their practice.</p>

        <p id="ai6" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The medical device company, Chemomouthpiece, LLC, has announced the publication of a pivotal trial's results in Supportive Care in Cancer. The study focused on the Chemo Mouthpiece, an FDA-cleared intraoral cryotherapy device used during chemotherapy treatment. The device significantly reduced patient-reported oral pain symptoms by 46% and opioid or analgesic use by 68%. It was well-tolerated with no safety issues and recommended by 83% of patients.

The trial, led by Richard Zuniga, MD, demonstrated the Chemo Mouthpiece's efficacy across over 30 chemotherapy regimens and 17 cancer types. Stephen Sonis, DMD, DMSc, highlighted that the device provides an effective and well-tolerated alternative to ice chips for oral mucositis management.

The Chemo Mouthpiece was invented by David Yoskowitz, a cancer survivor who experienced oral mucositis during his chemotherapy treatment. The device cools the entire oral cavity during and after infusion, helping to reduce mucosal injury caused by chemotherapy drugs. It was awarded Breakthrough Device Designation by the FDA in December 2021 and received FDA 510(k) clearance in January 2024.

Oral mucositis is a painful side effect of chemotherapy, causing inflammation and ulceration of the mouth's mucous membranes, affecting up to 80% of patients depending on cancer type. It can interfere with eating, speaking, and sleeping, reducing quality of life and delaying treatment. The Chemo Mouthpiece aims to alleviate these effects.

Chemomouthpiece, LLC is a privately held medical device company headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, dedicated to bringing patient-driven innovation to supportive oncology care.</p>

        <p id="ai10" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4, has sparked concerns among Alaska's Medicaid dental care providers due to anticipated increased demand and potential cuts in healthcare spending by nearly $1 trillion. Critics denounce these changes as harmful to healthcare services, with dental organizations, particularly the CareQuest Institute for Oral Health, labeling the bill's passage as detrimental to dentistry. The Alaska-based nonprofit organization, Anchorage Project Access, is experiencing historically high demand for its services and aims to partner with more practices to meet this increased need for care.</p>

        <p id="ai13" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The dental industry is experiencing both optimism and skepticism as recent updates unfold. Artificial Intelligence (AI) innovations are expected to significantly change dental practice tasks, with platforms like Alta AI's charting platform, Planet DDS and Pearl's AI Assist for diagnostic insights, and VideaHealth's ClaimsAI for faster claim submissions leading the way. However, concerns about Medicaid cuts loom large as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to decrease Medicaid spending by nearly $1 trillion, potentially leading to increased rates of untreated oral disease and strains on emergency departments.

DSO investments are picking up again after a slow period, with companies like Allied OMS, OMS360, Max Surgical Specialty Management, Blue Cloud Pediatric Surgery Centers, and Silver Creek Dental Partners gaining new funding this year. Moreover, several DSOs have expanded their networks into new states.

Despite the U.S. seeing disappointing employment results in June, healthcare sectors including dental offices saw reasonable gains, adding 7,100 employees specifically. However, staff recruitment remains a challenge for dentistry. The acquisition of Cherry Tree Dental by Delta Dental of Wisconsin has sparked concern and debate within the industry, with questions about access to dental care in rural areas, potential conflicts of interest, and legal implications under investigation. Lastly, efforts to end community water fluoridation and limit the mineral's use at state and federal levels are concerning dentists for their potential impact on oral health, with legislators working to ensure future decisions are based on non-partisan scientific evidence.</p>

        <p id="ai15" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">According to Statistics Canada, the percentage of Canadian employees with workplace medical and dental coverage has increased for the third consecutive year, reaching 66.8% in 2024. This trend is particularly noticeable among full-time and permanent workers, as well as those covered by collective agreements. However, a gender gap persists, with 63.8% of women having coverage compared to 69.5% of men. The data shows that coverage varies across provinces, with Saskatchewan, Manitoba, British Columbia, and Alberta reporting the highest rates, while Quebec, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador have the lowest. The lower rate in Quebec may be due to its unique public health insurance model. Meanwhile, the Canadian Dental Association has expressed concerns that the proposed federal Canadian Dental Care Plan could potentially diminish private dental insurance provided by employers, which is a significant source of coverage for many Canadians.</p>

        <p id="ai16" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article reports on a survey by Rater8, revealing that 31% of patients utilize generative AI like ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews to research or compare healthcare providers. This places AI as a significant influence factor alongside primary care referrals (28%) and healthcare review sites (29%). The findings suggest that traditional referral pipelines are weakening, and practices without strong AI visibility risk losing patients.

Online reviews continue to play a crucial role in provider selection, with 84% of patients checking online reviews before booking care in December 2024 and June 2025. Notably, over half (51%) of patients read at least six reviews before making decisions. Simultaneously, 73% of patients adopted new behaviors or tools to research providers, including AI chatbots, voice search assistants, and social media platforms.

The survey also found that patients are reevaluating who they trust when making healthcare decisions. A majority (61%) trust online reviews more than personal recommendations from friends or family. Approximately one-third of respondents trust AI-generated search results as much as traditional search engines like Google, with nearly one in five trusting AI even more. Only 11% expressed skepticism about AI-powered recommendations. Rater8 concluded that while AI can guide patients toward providers, "authentic patient experiences ultimately drive final decisions."</p>

        <p id="ai17" style="margin-top: 8px; color: #333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">The article discusses a novel technique for bonding auxiliary buttons in aligner therapy, developed by Dr Viet Anh Nguyen, a researcher at Phenikaa University in Hanoi. Unlike conventional methods, this thermal embedding technique eliminates debonding issues and increases chair time efficiency. The method involves softening the aligner polymer using heat from stainless steel buttons, allowing them to be embedded within the aligners. This adhesiveless bond is achieved through mechanical interlocking.

The technique has been observed to work mechanically without debonding under standard forces, making it suitable for immediate elastic traction cases such as Class III malocclusion and canine exposure. It serves as a backup for precision cut unavailability situations but should not be used with materials of low thermal resistance. The report notes that more studies are needed to validate the technique, but its mechanical efficacy has been demonstrated.

The benefits include increased clinical efficiency due to streamlined visits, reduced costs from eliminating bonding primers and adhesives, and aesthetic advantages for aligner therapy. The technique allows a trained dental assistant to perform the procedure under supervision, helping standardise workflow and free up dentist time. The report was published in the Cureus Journal of Medical Science on July 28, 2025.</p>

The plate, evaluated by the global VR-Haptic Thinkers consortium, was found to have potential but needs tactile property enhancements. The plate, featuring three distinct layers, is intended to provide students with a model closer to clinical reality. Evaluated by 70 dental educators from 14 institutions globally, the plate showed promise for beginners, offering ergonomic visibility, smoothness, and easy use. However, further research is needed to improve tactile realism and compare its value to conventional training tools. The findings will be presented at the 50th annual meeting of the Association for Dental Education in Europe in Dublin on August 21st. The study titled "Optimizing preclinical skill assessment for handpiece-naïve students: A strategic approach" was published online on August 11, 2025, in Dentistry Journal.</p>
